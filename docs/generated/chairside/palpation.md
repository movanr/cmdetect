Below is a **condensed, chairside quick-reference FAQ** designed to be **printed, laminated, or kept next to the dental chair**.
It prioritizes **what to remember in the moment**, not theory.

# DC/TMD Palpation – Chairside Quick Reference (FAQ)

---

## PRESSURE (Memorize This)

- **1.0 kg** → Temporalis, Masseter, TMJ capsule (around lateral pole)
- **0.5 kg** → TMJ lateral pole, supplemental muscles

✔ Calibrate finger **immediately before** palpation
✔ Use **one finger only**

---

## DURATION

- **2 seconds** → Myalgia / arthralgia screening
- **5 seconds** → Needed to detect referred pain

Think: **Press → Hold → Release**
(“one-thousand one, one-thousand two…”)

---

## ORDER OF EXAM

1. Temporalis (ant → mid → post)
2. Masseter (origin → body → insertion)
3. TMJ lateral pole (0.5 kg)
4. Around TMJ lateral pole (1.0 kg)
5. Supplemental muscles (if needed)

✔ One side at a time
✔ Teeth **not touching**

---

## PALPATION TECHNIQUE

- Locate muscle → then press
- Vertical pressure only (no rubbing)
- Stabilize head or mandible with other hand
- 3–5 sites per zone

---

## ALWAYS ASK (IN THIS ORDER)

1. **“Did you feel pain?”**
2. **“Is that familiar pain?”**
3. **“Did it stay under my finger, or go anywhere else?”**
4. **“Show me where you felt it.”**

✔ Silence ≠ no pain → confirm absence

---

## PAIN INTERPRETATION

- **Localized pain** → under finger only
- **Spreading pain** → beyond site but within same muscle
- **Referred pain** → into a different structure

⚠ “Deep” = clarify by having patient point

---

## MUSCLE PRIORITY

- Temporalis + masseter alone identify masticatory pain **~99%** of the time
- Supplemental muscles = optional, symptom-driven

---

## COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID

✘ Too light pressure
✘ Touch-and-go palpation
✘ Rubbing or sliding
✘ Bilateral palpation
✘ Skipping patient questions

---

## PATIENT LIMITATIONS

If patient withdraws or requests lighter pressure:

- Modify palpation
- Document limitation
- Interpret cautiously

---

## REMEMBER

✔ Standardized pressure
✔ Adequate hold time
✔ Systematic zones
✔ Clear pain questions

**Consistency > force**
