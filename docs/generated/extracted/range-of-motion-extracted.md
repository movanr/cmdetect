## 2. General Instructions for Measurements and Movements (from Section 2)

### 2.5 Measurements and Movements

**(a) Ruler preparation.** If necessary, a mm ruler is prepared by cutting off the end at the zero mark in order to make the end even with the '0' mark. The width of the ruler at the cut end should be sufficient to allow the ruler to be placed on an incisal edge without slipping. The non-measurement edge of the ruler may need to be trimmed back for a few cm at the '0' end in order to create space for the lip when placing the '0' end of the ruler against the maxillary incisors.

**(b) Millimeter measurements.** All millimeter measurements will be recorded as double digits; for example, a measurement of 41.7mm is rounded to 41mm and recorded only as an integer number. For values less than 10, the observed value is preceded by a leading zero. Measurements are rounded down to the nearest integer and recorded only as integer numbers. Each of overbite, overjet, and protrusive mandibular movement can take on a negative sign, indicated by checking the appropriate box on the examination form.

**(c) Measurements of range of motion.** Millimeter measurements of opening, protrusive, and lateral excursive movements are recorded as described in the specifications. Measurement of incisal relations is included in the examination in order for measured extent of movement to accurately reflect the full extent of movement for opening and protrusive excursions of the mandible. The examiner does not do these corrections during the examination; rather, the examiner records the observed values, and any adjustments are made after the examination is completed in order to compute actual mobility.

1. **Vertical movements** of the mandible are corrected by adding the vertical overlap; if the vertical incisal overlap is negative due to an anterior open bite, then the negative overlap is added to the observed extent of vertical movement.

2. **Lateral excursions** are corrected by adding or subtracting the midline discrepancy, as determined by the direction of any discrepancy between the maxillary and mandibular midlines. If any midline discrepancy has been negated via creation of an arbitrary reference midline, the principle remains the same but the value that is added or subtracted is '0'.

3. **Protrusive movements** are corrected by adding the measurement of protrusive movements to the horizontal overjet. When an anterior crossbite or prognathic relationship occurs, the negative overjet is added to the protrusive movement. And when a severe overjet (recorded as a positive number) is accompanied by mandibular protrusion that remains posterior to the maxillary teeth (recorded as a negative number), the sum of the two values correctly indicates the extent of mandibular movement in the protrusive direction.

**(d) Movement even with pain.** With one exception [**Pain-free opening**], every time the patient moves his/her mouth vertically or excursively, he or she is instructed to move it as far as possible in that direction, even if it is painful.

**(e) Movement without guidance.** Movements for range of motion and for joint sounds are made without any assistance by the examiner. Only for **Maximum Assisted Opening** is the jaw actively pushed on by the examiner. The examiner can touch the patient to provide non-verbal cues for the direction of intended movement.

## 3. Description of DC/TMD Examination Procedures (from Section 3)

### E2 Incisal Relationships

**Rationale.** The maxillary and mandibular incisors serve as stable landmarks for reliable measurements of mandibular range of motion in vertical as well as horizontal planes of movement.

**General.** The absence of both maxillary incisors, without prosthetic replacement, makes reliable measurement of mandibular range of motion challenging. Typically, the nasopalatine papilla is used as the maxillary landmark, or a lateral incisor might be used. Reliable landmarks in the edentulous mandible are more difficult to establish; typically, the estimated midline is used.

**Select maxillary and mandibular reference teeth.** Considering the position and shape of the maxillary incisors and their opposing mandibular incisors, select maxillary right central incisor (US #8, FDI #11) as the maxillary reference tooth if the incisal edge is horizontal and the tooth is relatively well-aligned within the arch, and if the opposing mandibular incisor fulfills similar criteria. Otherwise, select the maxillary left central incisor (US #9, FDI #21) if it and the opposing central incisor better fulfill these criteria. Note that the mesial-distal center of the incisal edge of the maxillary reference tooth will be the specific maxillary reference position for all vertical and protrusive mobility measurements. The reference position of the mandibular reference tooth is the part of the tooth that opposes the mesial-distal center of the maxillary reference tooth, and it is also used for all vertical and protrusive mobility measurements. Placing a vertical line on the particular part of the maxillary reference tooth, extended down to the part of the opposing mandibular tooth, may be helpful; see "Method 2" for adjusting midlines.

**Reference line – vertical overlap.** While posterior teeth are in the MICP position, a horizontal pencil mark is placed on the buccal surface of the mandibular reference tooth in relation to the maxillary reference tooth. Reverse these instructions if anterior cross-bite exists. Insure that the examiner's line of vision is in line with the horizontal occlusal plane to minimize error in placing the line more inferior or more superior than intended on the mandibular reference tooth.

**Reference line – maxillary & mandibular midline.** Inspect the relationship between the midline between the maxillary central incisors and midline between the mandibular central incisors. If one maxillary central incisor is missing, select the mesial incisal edge of the remaining central incisor as the reference. If neither central incisor is present, then select the nasopalatine papilla as the reference. If there is a diastema, measure from the mesial edge of the selected maxillary central incisor. Use prosthetic teeth if available. If the discrepancy between the maxillary and the mandibular midline is less than 1.0mm, then select the mandibular midline as the mandibular reference-midline for lateral excursive movements and consider the midlines to have a deviation of 0mm. Use "N/A" and mark '00' mm on the examination form.

If the discrepancy is 1.0mm or more, then select one of the following three methods for adjusting the midlines.

**Method 1:** The distance between the two midlines will be measured, rounded to the lowest whole mm, and recorded on the examination form. Note the direction that the mandibular midline deviates from the maxillary midline, and mark either "right" or "left".

**Method 2:** A vertical line is drawn on the labial surface of the maxillary reference tooth, and the line is extended down onto the facial surface of the opposing mandibular reference tooth. Lateral excursion measurements are made between these two lines. Use "N/A" to indicate that the midlines have been adjusted to a difference of 0mm and leave the number of mm blank.

**Method 3:** Select the maxillary midline as the maxillary reference point, and mark the labial surface of the opposing mandibular incisor with a vertical line that extends from the maxillary midline. In this case, the pencil line on the mandibular tooth is the mandibular reference midline. Use "N/A" to indicate that the midlines have been adjusted to a difference of 0mm and leave the number of mm blank.

**Incisal Overjet (horizontal overlap).** Measure distance from labial surface of mandibular reference incisor to labial surface of maxillary reference incisor. If anterior cross-bite situation exists, the field "if negative" on the examination form will be marked.

**Incisal Overbite (vertical overlap).** Measure the distance from the mandibular incisal edge to the marked horizontal line and record the measurement by placing the zero end of the ruler next to the line and measure to the mandibular incisal edge. Reverse these instructions if anterior cross-bite exists and measure the distance on the maxillary incisor. If open bite exists, the measurement is made between maxillary and mandibular incisal edges while the mandible is in the MICP position. The measurement of open bite is registered as a negative one, and the field "if negative" on the examination form should be marked.

### E3 Opening Pattern (Supplemental)

**Rationale.** Given the difficulty of making a reliable assessment and the rare utility for contributing to a formal DC/TMD diagnosis, this procedure was not included as a core component of the DC/TMD. However, the test has presumed utility for common diagnosis of disk displacement without reduction, with limitation, and for less common diagnoses (for example, muscle contractures or muscle guarding) and for identifying adaptive patterns in response to conditions such as unilateral masseter pain or disk displacement. The primary reason for retaining the test on a routine basis, however, is that it serves as a useful "warm-up" procedure for the patient before asking the patient to perform the opening mobility movements which are measured.

**Vertical guide and starting position.** A vertical reference line to monitor mandibular movement is perhaps the best method. While many approaches exist, the maxillary midline or the vertical mark on the incisors (Method 2 for measuring incisal relations) is simple to use. The teeth should be in MICP before beginning the procedure in order to observe for any lateral deflections in full closure perhaps dictated by the occlusion and to insure that any displaced disks are not already reduced prior to the opening phase. The patient's head should not be turned to the side for the convenience of the examiner as that will potentially alter movement dynamics of the mandible during opening. The examiner may lightly depress the lower lip in order to visualize the dental reference points. The straight edge of a millimeter ruler can be held vertically as a guide by gently aligning the ruler with the reference midline.

**Opening pattern.** The examiner asks the patient to *slowly* open three times, observing from a position *directly in front of the patient* for movements of the mandible in the frontal plane that depart from a line parallel with the mid-sagital plane. Slow opening is requested in order to fully visualize any non-linear movements. Two-three seconds from closed to fully open is a sufficient pace, while one second may be sufficient for a limited opening. If the patient exhibits more than one opening pattern then score all patterns that occur according to the following criteria. Additional opening sequences are permitted if the examiner needs to verify an observation. Note that only opening patterns are recorded.

a. ***Straight.*** This is defined as no or minimally perceptible deviation (< 2mm) upon opening. Choose this option if there is uncertainty regarding presence of a deviation. If any deviation is both minimal and inconsistent from trial to trial, choose this option.

b. ***Corrected Deviation*** *(includes right, left, or both).* The mandible exhibits a perceptible deviation (≥ 2 mm) to the right and/or left but returns to the midline before or upon reaching the maximum unassisted opening. Note that if opening is straight but closing exhibits clear deviation, the opening pattern is recorded as straight.

c. ***Uncorrected deviation*** *(specify right or left).* This is defined as deviation of the mandible of ≥ 2 mm to either the right or the left from the midline with maximum unassisted opening.

### E4 Open Movements

**Rationale.** Mobility testing addresses a core sign of TMD, is one of the most reliable clinical measures, and is a clinically appropriate outcome measure.

**General.** Measurements are taken between the incisal edges of the maxillary and mandibular reference teeth, as described in E2. The specific instructions that operationalize each of these different measures are stated in Sections 4 and 5. Pain-free opening and maximum unassisted opening are patient-based measures, while maximum assisted opening is examiner-based.

**E4_A Pain Free Opening.** The patient opens for the measurement. In certain settings, repeating the test, if the pain-free opening if less than 30mm, might be appropriate in order to assess for possible low-range outlying values.

**E4_B Maximum Unassisted Opening.** The patient opens for the measurement. Ask the patient about any pain produced by this procedure.

**E4_C Maximum Assisted Opening.** The patient opens for the measurement. The sequence of steps, as driven by the verbal commands, is designed to minimize the influence of guarding due to uncertainty on the part of the patient, but guarding occurs and while a standardized procedure assists in the detection of guarding, the identification of guarding is not, at this time, operationalized. The examiner has the option of repeating the procedure if s/he believes the patient prematurely terminated the procedure or responded with resistance. Cooperation and rapport between examiner and patient is critical for the success of this particular procedure. Ask the patient about any pain produced by this procedure.

**E4_D Opening Terminated.** If patient indicates to the examiner that the procedure should be stopped, [Yes] is endorsed. If the patient indicates for the procedure to be terminated simultaneous with the examiner's percept that the assisted opening has reached its maximum, [No] should be endorsed. For all other situations, [No] should be endorsed.

---

### E5 Lateral and Protrusive Movements

**Rationale.** Excursive movements complement open movements for full assessment of jaw mobility. These measurements are supplemental and may be omitted. The rationale for assessing lateral movements is to document the extent of the excursive movement(s) and any resultant (induced) in pain. Moreover, in certain settings, measurement of excursive movements serves to document if condylar movement was limited versus normal. The examination form provides fields for recording the extent of movement.

**General.** Lateral excursive measurements are made between the maxillary and mandibular reference midlines, while protrusive excursive measurement is made between the labial surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular reference teeth. If the patient cannot perform a movement, indicate this on the recording form by leaving the section blank. For the lateral excursive movements, if the patient is confused about direction s/he should move his or her jaw, touch the ipsilateral side of the face, lip, or even shoulder, and ask the patient to move towards the indicated side. Lateral pressure to the jaw by the examiner, as an aid to help the patient move in the requested direction, is very difficult to calibrate and consequently is discouraged.

**E5_A Right Lateral Excursion.** Ask the patient to move mandible to the patient's right. Record any reported pain.

**E5_B Left Lateral Excursion.** Ask patient to move mandible to the patient's left. Record any reported pain.

**E5_C Protrusion.** Ask patient to move the mandible forward. Record any reported pain. Note that if the mandibular incisors cannot be protruded beyond the maxillary incisors, the value will be negative; the form should be marked for the negative number. If the incisors exhibit a Class III situation in maximum closure, the horizontal overlap is recorded as a negative value (as explained in E2), but the protrusive movement, still measured as the distance from the labial surfaces of the maxillary to mandibular incisors, will be recorded as a positive number (consistent with the Class I situation where the mandibular incisor is anterior to the maxillary incisor).

## 5. Examination-Related Pain Interview for Range of Motion (from Section 6)

### 6.2.1 For range of motion maneuver-induced pain

| ITEM | INTERVIEW QUESTION | COMMENTS |
|---|---|---|
| **6.2.1** | **For range of motion maneuver-induced pain** | |
| | **Did you feel pain with that movement?** | _The intent of "with that movement" is whether the procedure caused pain or caused existing pain to change._ |
| | IF YES to pain: | _Refer to STRUCTURAL LOCALIZATION OF PAIN, Section 2._ |
| | **Could you point with your finger to each of the areas where you felt pain?** | |
| | **Are there any other areas where you felt pain with that movement? Point [with your finger] to those areas.** | |
| | Go to FAMILIAR PAIN INQUIRY. | |

### 6.2.4 Familiar Pain Inquiry

| ITEM | INTERVIEW QUESTION | COMMENTS |
|---|---|---|
| **6.2.4** | **Familiar Pain Inquiry** | |
| | **Is this pain familiar to any pain you have experienced in this area in the last 30 days?** | _COMMENT 1: Regarding "familiar", the examiner might elaborate with something like "Is this pain familiar, that is, similar or like, the pain that you have experienced in that area in the last 30 days?" Capturing the construct of replication is not always straightforward, as described in Section 2.9._ |
| | | _COMMENT 2: When evoked pain intensity differs from usual pain, ask: "Regardless of intensity, is this pain like your usual pain?"_ |
| | | _COMMENT 3: While the inquiry about familiar pain relates to the prior 30 days, some patients may volunteer information about possible pain experience in the period preceding the prior 30 days and report that a particular examination-induced pain is "familiar" to that pain. For example, in an individual with recurrent pain who has been pain-free in the 30 days prior to a consultation, palpation might elicit a pain that the patient remembers from a pain episode more than 30 days previously. The default time-frame for pain relevant to a diagnosis per the DC/TMD is the prior 30 days. However, different clinical or research situations may require a different time period. Consequently the time frame for "familiar pain" might need to be altered. Record any alternative time period in Section 11 of the exam form._ |
| | IF YES TO FAMILIAR PAIN: | |
| | **What is this pain familiar to?** | _COMMENT 1: For most clinical patients, the typical response is "the pain that I am complaining about". Once this reference frame is established in the first several inquiries to positive pain from examination, this question can usually be omitted. An exception occurs when additional information in the history suggests that the disorder underlying the pain complaint overlaps with other potential diagnoses, in which case the inquiry regarding replication of pain can be more extensive._ |
| | | _COMMENT 2: The query, "What is this pain familiar to?" in the patient seeking consultation may also result in new information that augments the history._ |
| | | _COMMENT 3: The query, "What is this pain familiar to?" may, in the asymptomatic individual, yield responses clearly not relevant to the present time, or it may yield responses that uncover a symptom history not previously reported. A common response in asymptomatic individuals is to report "familiar pain" referencing a dental visit or procedure._ |
| | IF TEMPORALIS SITE IS POSITIVE: | |
| | **Is this pain familiar to your headache in this area, in the last 30 days?** | _COMMENT 1: If pain is produced in the temporalis region from an examination procedure, the headache replication question is always asked regardless of the response to the more general question regarding "familiar pain". The responses to these two questions need not be the same._ |
| | | _COMMENT 2: In distinguishing "pain" from "headache", the most common question from the patient is whether it is sensible that his or her "headache" is familiar but "pain" is not familiar in response to the examination procedure. It is usually sufficient to simply reassure the patient that that response is fine. Alternatively, the relevant examination procedure can be repeated: ("Would you like me to repeat that procedure?"), and this allows the patient to reassess his/her experience when s/he responds to the pain inquiry questions._ |
| | | _COMMENT 3: When patients report "headache" in other masticatory structures (e.g., masseter region, TMJ region), this inquiry should also be performed for diagnostic purposes. The standard examination form does not have response option for this information but the finding can be recorded in the comments section of the examination form._ |
| | | _COMMENT 4: A 30-day time frame is used here in order to retain congruence with the time-frame for the masticatory system pain. The International Classification of Headache Disorders, version 2 (ICHD-2) criteria specify different time periods for Infrequent, Frequent and for Chronic Tension-Type Headaches. The user may want to alter the reference time period in this protocol for headache in order to be consistent with the ICHD-2 criteria. However, for Headache Secondary to TMD, there are currently no established time periods._ |
| | | _COMMENT 5: Palpation of asymptomatic areas can elicit a positive pain response, and during the inquiry a patient might report that the pain in such areas is "familiar". It may be that the clinical pain is present in that location and which the patient believed to be asymptomatic, in which case the area is recoded as painful in item 1 of the examination. Alternatively, a patient may report that palpation pain in an asymptomatic location is "familiar" because that pain experience is similar to the pain that is experienced in another area of the body. The response for "familiar" pain in this example is \|no\| since the pain provoked by examination must be familiar to a pain experienced in the same body region._ |
| | Examiner verifies that reported pain areas in Q1 of the exam are consistent with body areas reported as positive for familiar pain. | |

## 6. Illustrations for Range of Motion (from Section 7)

### E2 Incisal Relationships

#### Reference Lines

**Figure 4.** Select the maxillary reference tooth. Draw a horizontal line on the facial surface of the opposing mandibular incisor, using the incisal edge of the maxillary incisor as the guide. Insure that the pencil mark is level with the maxillary incisal edge; holding the pencil at an angle to the patient's horizontal plane will cause the overbite line to be displaced.

**Figure 5a.** (left) The mesial-incisal edge of the maxillary central incisor (US #8, FDI #11) is within 1.0 mm of being in line with the mandibular incisal midline; these midlines are acceptable landmarks for lateral excursive measurements. (right) Illustration of congruent midlines; horizontal line from Figure 4 also shown.

**Figure 5b.** (left) Mesial-incisal edge of the maxillary central incisor is more than 1.0mm away from the mandibular incisal midline. Horizontal line from Figure 4 also shown. (right) A corresponding vertical line is drawn from the maxillary dental midline down the opposing mandibular incisor. Horizontal line from Figure 4 also shown.

**Figure 6.** (left) Alternative method for creating midline reference lines: draw a vertical line across the face of the maxillary reference incisor and down onto the opposing mandibular incisor. (right) Illustration of line drawn across center of maxillary central incisor, extending to the opposing mandibular incisor. Horizontal line also shown for vertical overlap.

#### Measurements

**Figure 7.** Extent of horizontal overlap is measured. Note that the ruler is contacting the mesial-distal center of the maxillary central incisor. If an incisor is rotated, as the maxillary central incisor is in this instance, the contact position with the incisor will influence the measured horizontal overlap.

**Figure 8.** Extent of vertical overlap is measured. As shown, the tip of ruler is placed adjacent to the incisal edge, and the distance to the horizontal line is read. Alternatively, especially if the lower lip interferes with ruler placement, the ruler tip may be placed at the line, with the ruler extending toward the maxilla, and the distance to the mandibular incisal edge is read. For all measures, round down to the closest mm.

### E3 Opening Pattern (Supplemental)

**Figure 9.** (top) Opening pattern may be assessed with or without any reference lines. Illustrated is a ruler placed against the end of the maxillary central incisor; note that the edge of the ruler is about 2mm from the mesial incisal edge of the right central incisor. Because the lower lip deviated to the patient's left, it appears as though the mandible deviated to the left; however, inspection of the mandibular incisal midline reveals that that midline is also just to the patient's left of the ruler. Since the mandibular midline is within 2 mm of the maxillary midline and because the mandible opened along the path (not shown) illustrated by the ruler, this is a straight opening pattern. See illustrations in Figure 10 for further clarification. If the reference midline is an open incisal embrasure between two teeth (as shown here), placing the ruler against the incisal edge is a stable landmark compared to placing the ruler into the incisal embrasure.

(bottom) In this illustration, the ruler is now placed to the facial side of the incisal embrasure, but _not_ in the embrasure between the two maxillary central incisors. Since the mandibular midline has moved more than 2mm to the patient's right during opening, this would be classified as an uncorrected deviation.

**Figure 10a.** Illustration of the 4 types of opening patterns.

- (left) Straight opening; note that mandibular midline is not coincident with maxillary midline.
- (right) Slight deviation in opening, but less than 2mm zone from the midline; this is recorded as straight.

**Legend.** Solid red line denotes the 2mm threshold on each of right and left sides from the midline, creating a middle 4mm wide zone. Dotted green line denotes path of mandibular movement. Black line denotes the sagittal midline, as would be visualized if a ruler were placed vertically as shown in Figure 9 (bottom).

**Figure 10b.** Illustration of the 4 types of opening patterns (continued).

- (left) Mandible deviates to the right side, more than 2mm from the midline, and returns to the midline zone (i.e., within the 4mm zone). This would be classified as a corrected deviation.
- (right) Mandible deviates to the right side and does not return to the midline zone; this is classified as an uncorrected deviation. The side (whether to the right or left) to which the mandible deviates is also selected.

See Figure 10a for legend.

### E4 Open Movements

#### E4_A Pain Free Opening

**Figure 11.** The tip of the ruler is placed against the incisal edge of the mandibular reference incisor, and the distance to the mesial-distal center of the edge of the maxillary central incisor is read. Round the value down to the nearest full mm.

#### E4_B Maximum Unassisted Opening

**Figure 12.** Tip of ruler is placed as before, and patient is asked to open as wide as possible, even if painful.

**Figure 13.** (left) Patient is asked to point to any area(s) of pain experienced with this movement. (right) The examiner touches the indicated area to confirm underlying structure, and then asks if this pain is "familiar".

**Figure 14.** (left) Pain that is provoked by a range of motion procedure is sometimes difficult for the patient to localize after returning the mandible to the closed position. In this instance, the examiner asked the patient to again open as wide as possible, even if painful, and the patient is then asked to point to any area of pain while the mandible is still in the maximally open position. (right) With the mandible in the same position (i.e., maximally open), the examiner touches the indicated area to confirm underlying structure, and then asks if this pain is "familiar".

#### E4_C Maximum Assisted Opening

**Figure 15.** Examiner first places the ruler in position and after insuring that the patient opened to the same extent as during the prior Maximum Unassisted Opening, the fingers are placed in the scissors-position and the examiner then stretches the mouth further open, if possible.

(not illustrated) If patient requests examiner to stop, then **E4_D Opening Terminated** is recorded as "yes". Otherwise, it is recorded as "no".

**Figure 16.** (left) Patient is asked to point to any area of pain experienced with this movement. (right) Examiner touches area to confirm underlying structure, and then asks if this pain is "familiar".

### E5 Lateral & Protrusive Movements

#### E5_A Right Lateral Excursion

**Figure 17.** Ruler is placed in horizontal position with tip at the mandibular midline reference position. Patient moves mandible to right while examiner retracts lips as necessary with other hand. The extent of movement is 5mm, reading from the mesial-incisal edge of the maxillary right central incisor.

**Figure 18.** Patient is asked to point to any area(s) of pain. As necessary, examiner touches area to confirm underlying structure, and then asks if this pain is "familiar".

#### E5_B Left Lateral Excursion

**Figure 19.** Ruler is placed in horizontal position with tip at the maxillary midline reference position. In this instance, the ruler tip is about 1mm short of being in line with the reference position (i.e., mesial-incisal edge of the maxillary right central incisor), a common source of error with these measurements. Patient moves mandible to left while examiner retracts lips as necessary with other hand. The measured value at the mandibular incisal midline is not quite 6.0mm, so the recorded value would be 5 mm.

The pain location is investigated as described in Figure 18.

#### E5_C Protrusion

**Figure 20.** The ruler is placed in horizontal position with tip on the buccal surface of the maxillary reference tooth (as indicated by the vertical line in the center area of the incisor, which is partially visible in this image). Patient moves mandible in protrusive direction while examiner retracts lips as necessary with other hand.

The pain location is investigated as described in Figure 18.

(left) Ruler is held with face of the ruler directed upward; (right) ruler is held with face of the ruler directed to the side. In this situation, holding the ruler as shown in the left image is generally better than the position shown in the right image since the examiner can read downward from ruler to mandibular incisal edge.

#### Alternative Measurement Method for Lateral Excursions

##### E5_A & B Right and Left Lateral Excursions

**Figure 21.** If the alternative vertical reference marks as shown in Figure 6 are used, then lateral excursions are measured as shown. In order to demonstrate the line markings on the mandibular incisors, the ruler is held further away (inferior) from the maxillary incisal edge than would be done in practice.

(top) Ruler is placed in horizontal position with tip at the mandibular midline reference position, as indicated by the vertical line on the mandibular incisor. Patient moves mandible to right while examiner retracts lips as necessary with other hand. The read value on the ruler, corresponding with the vertical reference line on the maxillary reference incisor, is 7mm.

(bottom) Ruler is placed in horizontal position with tip corresponding to the line on the maxillary reference incisor. Patient moves mandible to the left, examiner retracts lips as necessary, and the ruler is read. Although the line on the mandibular incisor is barely visible, the read value is 7mm.

## 8. Additional Range of Motion Related Information

### From Section 2.6 Classification of Anatomic Structures

**(c) The problem of dynamic movement.** During maximal opening movements in particular and sometimes with lateral or protrusive excursive movements, the condyle will move anteriorly such that it is deep to overlying masseter muscle. When asking the patient where the pain was during the preceding procedure, the patient may point to the area anterior to the condyle in its closed position. The patient may be pointing to the masseter muscle (for example) but the patient may instead (or also) be pointing to the location of where the condyle was. When the pain during the maneuver is caused in part or in whole by the condyle in an anteriorly translated position, light pressure to the reported pain area (while the patient's mandible is in the closed position) by the examiner and inquiring into if that was the pain just experienced may lead to an unsure patient response. If so, repeat the opening or excursive procedure and then identify the location (and underlying structure) of any pain while the mandible is in the open or excursive position. The patient may also be asked if the "pain was coming from the part that was moving".

### From Section 2.3 Patient Management

**(c) Jaw posture.** There are three static jaw postures used in this examination: comfort position, where the mouth is closed (i.e., lips touching, for most individuals) and teeth are not touching; maximal intercuspal position (MICP), where the jaw is closed and teeth are fully touching; and where the jaw is held at the end of a movement (e.g., opening). Unless instructions indicate otherwise, the jaw should be in the comfort position. Procedures requesting that the patient bring the teeth together refer to the MICP; MICP is obtained by asking the patient to "put your back teeth completely together", and the additional phrase "where your back teeth fit together best" can be used as needed in order to help the patient accomplish that goal. MICP in patients with dual bite should be obtained by asking the patient to close teeth together with the mandible in the more posterior position.

### From Section 2.4 Completing the Examination

**(c) Repeating examination items.** The examiner can repeat a procedure if the finding is inconsistent, if the patient was unable to provide a clear response, or if the patient requests that the procedure be repeated.

### From Section 2.12 Examination Form

**(c) Form structure logic.** While all items should be completed, not all response fields need to be completed. Parts 1, 2, and 3 are typical checklists. The remaining sections of the examination utilize a conditional reporting format.

1. If the response from the initial inquiry about presence of pain from the procedure is reported by the patient as "no", then record [N]. All other response options for that item are left blank since no response is needed.

2. If initial inquiry response about presence of pain is "yes", the examiner records [Y] to **Pain**. Then the examiner will ask a series of further questions depending on the type of examination procedure that induced the pain.

3. **Familiar Pain** and **Familiar Headache** co-exist as parallel forms of inquiry because some individuals will report temporalis area "pain" as different from temporalis "headache" with respect to an examination procedure provoking that particular pain or headache experience. This was addressed in section 2.9.

4. A response for **Referred Pain** is recorded if **Pain** is "yes" and independent of whether **Familiar Pain** or **Familiar Headache** are "yes".

5. **Example.** In Part 4B, if the patient reports pain only in the right temporalis and right masseter during maximum unassisted opening, [Y] would be marked in the Pain column for the right temporalis and the examiner would proceed with the Examination-related Pain Interview, asking if the pain was familiar, if the provoked pain (or noxious experience) was familiar to headache, and if the pain was referred. For the masseter muscle, the Examination-related Pain Interview would address if the pain was familiar and if the pain was referred. For all other muscles and both TMJs, [N] is marked in the Pain column and because the remaining columns are not applicable, they are left blank.
