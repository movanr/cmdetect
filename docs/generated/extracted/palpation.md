## 2. General Instructions for Palpation (from Section 2)

### 2.8 Palpation

**(a) Selection of palpation sites.** Research data indicate that palpation procedures to the masseter and temporalis muscles are the most reliable, and, more importantly, data from the Validation Project demonstrate that these two muscles bilaterally are sufficient for diagnostic yield 99% of the time. Although the false negative rate by only using these two muscles bilaterally is therefore about 1%, in clinical settings it may still be useful to include the less reliable masticatory muscles for palpation in order to provide a comprehensive examination (see Section 3) relative to the patient's complaint. That is, if the masseter temporalis muscles are negative for pain from the examination, examination of any of the other supplemental muscles (lateral pterygoid area, posterior mandibular area, submandibular area, temporalis tendon) may be positive and allow for a myofascial pain diagnosis in the masticatory muscles. Only using the masseter and temporalis for palpation yields an examination that is targeted and more efficient, with only slightly less diagnostic sensitivity.

**(b) Basic screening palpation.** Palpation for pain is performed by applying pressure, which is either 0.5 kg or 1.0 kg, depending on the procedure or structure, in order to test for a pain response. This procedure should be distinguished from lighter pressure used in touching the skin in order to identify location of reported pain and identification of the structures beneath the skin. Palpation for pain consists of two phases: initial contact with the skin and ramping the pressure to the desired target (ramp phase), and maintaining that pressure for a sufficient duration (steady-force phase). Patients report that they do not regard "touch and go" palpation (i.e., very brief application of pressure at an area) as satisfactory for their feeling confident about whether they experienced pain in response to the palpation pressure. Consequently, after ramping the pressure up to the desired magnitude, a steady level of palpation pressure needs to be maintained for at least one full second, recognizing that part of a 2-second palpation procedure will include time for ramping up to the target pressure and ramping down from the target pressure.

**(c) How many fingers?** One finger is recommended in order to best standardize the examination. Two fingers are often used in clinical settings but require more complex calibration procedures to achieve reliable assessment.

**(d) Simultaneous bilateral palpation?** Examining both sides at the same time is more efficient than doing one side at a time. However, obtaining maximal reliability in the necessary patient report of pain, whether the pain is familiar and whether the pain refers to another structure, is facilitated by examining one side at a time. This protocol is designed toward examining only one side at a time.

**(e) Palpation duration.** The application of suitable pressure for assessing pain from palpation requires that each screening palpation procedure have a duration of at least 2 seconds, if a myalgia diagnosis is to be provided and for at least 5 seconds if a diagnosis of any one of the myalgia types (local myalgia, myofascial pain with spreading, or myofascial referred pain) is to be provided. The following method, using a timing phrase of "one-thousand 1, one-thousand 2", will lead to palpation duration of about two seconds, with the steady-force phase lasting about 1 second. The onset of finger contact with the underlying surface occurs with the first "**one**-" (of "**one**-thousand 1"), full target force is developed by the end of that phrase at "**1**" (of "one-thousand **1**"), and pressure offset occurs with "**2**" (of "one-thousand **2**"). The short phrase "press, hold, release" might be useful as a mental reminder during each procedure. This procedure is modified appropriately if a 5 second palpation is used; even better, however, for a 5 second palpation is to time pressure application according to a wall clock.

**(f) Palpation calibration.** A critical skill for reliable palpation is producing the proper force in a steady manner which requires on-going skill development and maintenance. The examiner should train him/herself using an appropriate force-measuring device such as a digital postage scale or a suitable handheld algometer. Each instrument has specific benefits. The digital postage scale is very accurate and responsive to ongoing pressure application but does not have a form-factor that is useful in the clinic setting. See Section 10 for further information regarding the calibration process. Calibration by the examiner of his or her fingers for each type of pressure just before doing that part of the examination is recommended.

**(g) Procedure.** After instructing the patient (see Section 5 or 8 for detailed verbal instructions), the examiner then palpates each targeted spot by ramping up to the target pressure (e.g., 1.0 kg) and holding the pressure for the specified time. The recommended time periods are either for 2 seconds (if only a diagnosis of myalgia is of interest or concern) or for 5 seconds (if a diagnosis of referred pain is also of interest). Then, the Familiar Pain Inquiry is done, and if positive, the Referred Pain Inquiry. All of the accessible muscle should be palpated. The examiner may additionally focus on specific sites within a muscle, as indicated by the circumstances (e.g., patient complaint that suggests referred pain and a possible anatomic source for that referred pain).

**(h) Confirmation of pain absence.** During the palpation procedures, the patient is instructed to report pain following application of pressure. Some examiners prefer to have a patient say "yes" or "no" after each procedure, whereas others prefer to only hear "yes", if applicable. A hybrid procedure is to inquire at the end of each temporalis or masseter zone or after each muscle, as appropriate, with the question, "any pain?" or "there was no pain?" in order to confirm that the absence of pain reports is due to the absence of pain.

## 3. Description of DC/TMD Examination Procedures (from Section 3)

### E9 Muscle and TMJ Pain with Palpation

**Rationale.** Pain induced in muscles via palpation is a classic clinical test. The intent is to determine if the patient reports pain from palpation of a muscle or joint and determine if any induced pain duplicates or replicates the patient's pain complaint. Several approaches are available, depending on the purpose of the examination. See Part 2.12.e for description of the examination form pertinent to temporalis and masseter palpation.

#### General

(a) Palpating the muscles and joint capsules for pain requires that the examiner press on a specific site using the spade-like pad of one finger (the second or third digits; or index finger or middle finger) with standardized pressure. The "spade-like" area of the finger is the space between the tip (just adjacent to the edge of finger nail) and the finger-print area. One finger is used and finger placement is as shown in the illustrations, Section 7.

(b) Within each group of muscle sites as indicated on the examination form, apply pressure to the right side and then to the left side. When applying pressure, support the head or mandible by placing the other hand on the opposite side of the head in order to provide stability. During palpation, the patient's mandible should be in a comfortable position, without the teeth touching.

(c) Each major muscle (temporalis, masseter) is divided into 3 zones for purposes of insuring that the muscle is examined in a consistent manner. Responses may be recorded for each zone or for the muscle as a whole; alternate examination forms exist for each approach. Within each zone, 3-5 areas should be palpated, depending on the size of the muscle and the intent of the examination.

(d) Due to the inherent difficulty in an examiner exactly calibrating his/her finger pressure when going from measurement scale to actual palpation, the examiner should target no less than the indicated value. For example, a target of 1 kg should be at least as great as 1.0 kg but not less. Target "pressures" are 1 kg (as measured by a force meter) to the temporalis and masseter muscles and around the lateral pole of the TMJ and 0.5 kg to the lateral condylar pole of the TMJ and any supplemental muscle areas.

(e) If the examiner is unable to palpate at the specified amount of pressure due to the patient's physical withdrawal or the patient's request for the palpation to be more gentle, then such information is recorded in the Examination Comments section, and the palpation should be modified accordingly.

(f) In a given setting, diagnosis of myalgia may be the sufficient end-point and further investigation for presence of referred pain may not be needed. If so, the palpation and pain reporting procedures (by the patient) should be accordingly modified.

(g) **Summary of palpation principles**
   - i. Locate, then palpate.
   - ii. Press on the site using the correct amount of steady pressure, without moving the fingers sideways or rubbing the area.
   - iii. Be systematic in how each defined region is examined.

#### Approaches

(a) In addition to setting stimulus intensity, palpation consists of two additional parameters that can be altered depending on the clinical or research question to be answered: location and stimulus duration.

(b) Location consists of how much of a structure is examined; the masseter and temporalis are large enough that more than a few palpation sites are required to fully examine the muscle. Such structures may be examined by applying the palpation pressure to every aspect of the muscle in order to insure that no area is missed, or a sampling approach may be used where only selected parts of the muscle are examined on a routine basis. In clinical settings, a sampling approach is often augmented by additional palpation as guided by the patient history and diagnostic hypotheses. Other smaller structures such as the TMJ are readily examined in a complete manner.

(c) Stimulus duration refers to how long the palpation pressure is held. The minimum duration for the DC/TMD is 2 seconds (which is sufficient for a diagnosis of myalgia but likely insufficient for a referred pain diagnosis), and a duration of (at least) 5 seconds is recommended if identification of referred pain is important. There are two methods associated with stimulus duration, depending on the desired outcome from the examination.

(d) **Method 1.** Use 5 seconds duration for every palpation. If false negative diagnoses for myofascial pain with referral must be minimized, then palpation of every muscle and joint site with (at least) 5 full seconds of palpation pressure is necessary, and referred pain and hyperalgesia will be more reliably detected. Watching a clock to insure adequate stimulus duration is recommended.

   a. To shorten the time required for the palpation procedures, after 2 seconds or so and while continuing to hold the pressure, the examiner may prompt with the question of "pain?", and other prompts ("familiar?", "familiar headache?", and "referred?") may be possible within the remaining time until (at least) 5 seconds has elapsed. Any unasked pain inquiry questions may then be asked for that palpation site.

   b. To reduce impact of multiple "pain?" prompts, simply ask about pain just before the end of the 5-second pressure application, and then proceed with the remaining prompts after removing the pressure.

   c. The intent of the prolonged palpation (holding a pressure for a full 5 seconds) is to identify the possible presence of referred pain. This procedure can be altered depending on patient response; a highly pain-sensitive individual may not readily tolerate 5 seconds of pressure in a given area, and the Comments section of the examination form should be used for recording such observations and that, for example, the examination for referred pain was not performed. However, in practice 5-seconds of pressure is tolerable.

(e) **Method 2.** Use 2 seconds duration for every palpation. If identification of referred pain is not important in a given examination or setting, then palpation with only 2 seconds duration will be generally sufficient to identify myalgia and arthralgia. This approach is particularly well-suited if the clinical evaluation serves as a gateway for referral. Instructions include: **Now I am going to apply pressure to different areas of your head and jaw, and I will ask about pain.** And: **I will hold the pressure for 5 seconds [or 2 seconds], and I will then ask you about pain; please tell me yes or no, and if so I will then ask you if the pain is familiar, and if the pain stays under my finger or if you feel it also in different areas of your head or jaw.**

#### Description of Specific Extraoral Muscle Sites

(a) *Temporalis Anterior – 1.0 kg.* Start just posterior to the bony crest lateral to the eyebrow and superior to the zygomatic process of the temporal bone. Request muscle contraction via patient clenching as necessary in order to insure that muscle tissue is beneath the finger. The area for palpation lies along a curve parallel to the anterior extent of the muscle; lightly palpate for the bony crest defining the anterior boundary of the temporal fossa.

(b) *Temporalis Middle – 1.0 kg.* Start just anterior of the ear and superior to the zygomatic process of the temporal bone; the area for palpation is directly superior.

(c) *Temporalis Posterior – 1.0 kg.* Start just above the superior tip of the ear; the area for palpation is directly superior. Ask the patient to clench and then relax to help identify muscle boundaries, as necessary.

(d) *Origin of Masseter – 1.0 kg.* Request that the patient first clench and then relax in order to confirm (1) the location of the posterior extent of the muscle with respect to the anterior border of the TMJ condyle and (2) the anterior border of the masseter. Start at the posterior extent, just inferior to the zygomatic process of the temporal bone; the area for palpation is directly anterior.

(e) *Body of the Masseter – 1.0 kg.* Start at the posterior boundary of the muscle, midway between origin and insertion. The area for palpation is directly anterior.

(f) *Insertion of the Masseter – 1.0 kg.* Start at the posterior boundary of the muscle, just superior to the inferior mandibular border; the area for palpation is directly anterior.

#### Description of Specific Joint Palpation Sites

(a) *Lateral Pole – 0.5 kg.* Place index finger just anterior to the tragus of the ear and on the skin overlying the patient's TMJ. In order to confirm location, ask the patient to open or protrude slightly until the examiner feels the lateral pole of the condyle translated forward.

(b) *Around the Lateral Pole – 1.0 kg.* While the mandible is in the comfort position or in a slightly protruded position, place index finger just anterior to the tragus of the ear and dorsal to the TMJ. While the mandible is supported from the other side, the index finger presses while orbiting around the lateral pole in a circular fashion over the superior aspect of the condyle and then anteriorly – i.e., from the 9:00 to the 3:00 position, and then continuing fully around the condyle. Two-five seconds duration for this procedure yields the appropriate pace of finger movement.

**Examiner calibration.** The examiner calibrates the necessary fingers at the specified palpation "pressure", just prior to that set of palpations.

**Examination sequence.** A practice trial is optional and may be performed on the deltoid muscle or frontalis muscle. Figures related to palpation are shown in Section 7. In order to maximize examiner consistency, the following sequence is used:

- Temporalis and masseter, right side and then left side (1 kg), following order of zones as listed above.
- Lateral pole of TMJ, right side and then left side (0.5 kg)
- Around the TMJ condyle, right side and then left side (1 kg)
- Supplemental muscles (0.5 kg), as indicated.

**Palpation and pain inquiry.** The examiner inquires about pain from the palpation, whether the pain is familiar, and the anatomical extent of the pain. For the latter, the examiner asks the patient to show (with a fingertip) where the pain was felt. Verbal responses such as "to my ear" or "deep" are accepted as evidence of extension of the palpation-induced pain, while ambiguous responses from the patient are interpreted as [no]. This protocol requires that "referral" denotes pain felt in a different structure than that which is being examined via palpation.

## 6. Illustrations for Palpation (from Section 7)

### E9 Muscle and TMJ Pain with Palpation

**Figure 24.** Extraoral masticatory muscles: temporalis and masseter. Illustration demonstrates palpation pathways for temporalis and masseter, and with three palpation areas per zone. Note that the anterior zone of the temporalis is slightly curved, corresponding to the outline of the muscle. The goal is to palpate each zone as fully as possible, so palpate a minimum of three areas within each zone using 1 kg of pressure.

The DC/TMD examination form within this protocol provides a recording field for each of the three bands. The use of zones for palpation is recommended because such usage enhances systematic coverage of the muscle during the palpation examination.

An alternative examination form (available on the Consortium web site) denotes only a single recording field for each of masseter and temporalis (given that a diagnosis is muscle based, not muscle-zone based), in case that is more useful in a given setting.

Key: filled circle denotes one finger tip.

**Figure 25.** Finger pressure is calibrated (1.0 kg) using a simple hand-held algometer prior to palpation examination of the temporalis and masseter. Note that a single finger is calibrated, and that the palpating finger of each hand must be calibrated if using both hands during the examination.

### Temporalis (1 kg of pressure)

**Figure 26.** Orange areas illustrate the zones of palpation for the three areas of the temporalis: posterior, middle, and anterior.

**Figure 27.** Palpation sequence for the temporalis muscle. Note that the other hand stabilizes the head.

- (left) Starting with the anterior zone (posterior to the bony margin of the anterior temporalis), the examiner starts at the area just above the zygomatic arch, as shown by the lowest filled circle in this zone as shown in Figure 24, and continues within the zone until the superior boundary of the muscle is reached. In this image, a middle area of the anterior zone is palpated.
- (center) Middle zone (in front of the ear): the examiner starts just above the zygomatic arch, and continues until the superior boundary of the muscle is reached. The tendonous area immediately above the arch should also be included, as shown by the lowest filled circle in this zone as shown in Figure 24.
- (right) Posterior zone (in line with the top of the ear): the examiner starts just above the ear corresponding to the lowest filled circle in this zone as shown in Figure 24, and continues until the superior boundary of the muscle is reached.

### Masseter (1 kg of palpation pressure)

**Figure 28.** Orange areas illustrate the zones of palpation for the three areas of the masseter: superior, middle, and inferior. Note that the superior zone begins just anterior to the condyle when the mandible is in the relaxed position.

See Figure 24 legend for description of examination forms.

**Figure 29.** Palpation sequence for the masseter muscle while the other hand stabilizes the mandible.

- (left) Origin zone (inferior to the bony margin of the zygomatic process): the examiner started at the area just anterior to the condyle, corresponding to the filled circle in this zone as shown in Figure 24.
- (center) Body zone (in front of ear lobe): start at the most posterior aspect of the muscle.
- (right) Insertion zone: start at the area superior and anterior to the mandibular angle. In each zone, the palpation continues until the anterior boundary of the muscle is reached.

**Figure 30.** Alternative form of palpation for the insertion of the masseter muscle. The skin overlying the insertion area of the masseter often rolls when applying pressure in this area. The forefinger is being used for palpation, as shown in Figure 29 (right), while the middle finger is placed beneath the mandibular border and held in light but firm contact. While placing the middle finger, the skin is drawn downward, thus providing a firmer base for the forefinger to palpate the muscle and simultaneously providing better support for the palpating hand.

### Temporomandibular Joint

#### TMJ lateral pole (0.5 kg of palpation pressure)

**Figure 31.** Target area for lateral pole palpation of the TMJ.

**Figure 32.** Anatomical landmarks relative to tragus of the ear, with teeth in lightly closed position.

**Figure 33.** One finger is used, and one joint is palpated at a time; the other hand is used to stabilize the head. Note that mouth remains closed. Use 0.5 kg.

#### Dynamic TMJ lateral pole palpation (1 kg of palpation pressure)

**Figure 34.** Condyle is protruded to a forward position (indicated by solid white solid line, as shown here), sufficient to allow access for palpation of the dorsal aspect of the condylar head. Dashed white line corresponds to closed condylar position.

**Figure 35.** The lateral pole is identified after the mandible is sufficiently protruded. The filled green dot indicates the position of the finger at the posterior aspect of the lateral pole; the green dot is the starting point for the finger which is rolled first anteriorly and superiorly around the superior circumference of the lateral pole, as shown here. The finger continues around the condyle, while maintaining contact with the circumferential aspect of the lateral pole, and the orbital movement continues until the finger returns to the dorsal aspect of the lateral pole.

**Figure 36.** Photo shows placement of finger, with pad of finger adjacent to the dorsal aspect of the lateral pole; photo also demonstrates that condyle is moved forward slightly via protrusion. Use 1.0 kg.

#### Posterior and Sub-mandibular Areas

**Figure 37.** Posterior and submandibular masticatory muscle areas: green dot indicates finger placements and arrows illustrate direction of the respective forces.

Key: filled circle denotes one finger tip.

**Figure 38.** Use 0.5 kg.

**Figure 39.** (left) Patient extends head anteriorly in order to open the space posterior and medial to the posterior border of the mandible. The examiner places the finger in the space that is opened, and presses anteriorly and medially. (right) Finger is placed on the medial aspect of the inferior border of the mandible, as shown, with force directed superiorly and laterally (i.e., against the medial wall of the mandible). The patient can be asked to retract her head and drop the chin in order to allow the palpating finger to move as described.

#### Lateral Pterygoid Area

**Figure 40.** Finger is placed as shown, while mandible is deviated to the same side. Palpate the most medial, superior, and posterior area in the vestibule.

#### Temporalis Tendon

**Figure 41.** Finger is placed against the ascending ramus while the mandible is slightly open, and the finger is moved superiorly as far as possible while maintaining contact with the underlying hard surface.

## 8. Additional Palpation-Related Information

### From Section 2.6 Classification of Anatomic Structures

**(b) Identify involved areas of pain.** The first time that a participant points to a location that is uncertain in terms of anatomical identity, the examiner will investigate the possible underlying structures. Subsequent pointing by the participant to that same location should allow the examiner to code the structure(s), based on the initial inquiry.

1. **Patient points to pain locations.** When a patient indicates that a mobility test is painful, the examiner determines the location(s) of the pain induced during the procedure by asking the patient to *point* to each area of pain with one fingertip or to show the area of involvement by "painting" the boundary with a fingertip. The examiner then determines what area(s) the patient has indicated and then records all of the selected locations (as available, depending on the item): temporalis, masseter, sub-mandibular, posterior mandibular, lateral pterygoid, temporalis tendon, and TMJ. These pain-site locations are independent. If the patient reports the location of the pain as, for example, "my joint", the examiner will ask the patient to point to or show the location.

2. **Examiner touches area.** It is essential that the examiner correctly identifies the area(s) that the patient is indicating. To insure accuracy, the examiner can place his/her finger on the area(s), and/or the patient can place the examiner's finger on the area(s) that the patient indicates as the location(s) of his/her pain.

### From Section 2.10 Referred Pain

**(a) Definition.** Pain is considered *referred pain* if the patient reports pain beyond the boundary of the muscle or joint being palpated (i.e., perceived in another structure). It is not referred pain if the patient reports pain extending beyond the area of provocation but only within the boundary of the muscle or joint.

**(b) Localization.** If the patient reports pain as a result of muscle or TMJ palpation, the patient is asked if s/he felt pain anywhere else (i.e., in any other structure) beyond the immediate area of the examiner's palpation, and if so to point to that area. If the site of any referred pain is deep, then the patient should still be asked to point to the skin (or mucosa) overlying the deep area.

**(c) Spreading pain.** The DC/TMD includes a placeholder for "spreading pain", defined as pain that extends beyond the area of nociceptive stimulation but not beyond the boundary of the muscle being palpated.

### From Section 2.12 Examination Form

**(e) Temporalis and masseter palpation.** The examination form attached to this protocol has 3 report fields for each of temporalis and masseter, each field corresponding to a delineated palpation zone. The purpose of zones within these muscles is to enhance structured training and systematic practice. In a clinical setting, only the diagnosis may be of interest, and if familiar pain, familiar headache, and referred pain are obtained from the first site examined within the temporalis, the examiner could easily conclude examination of that muscle and move on to the next part of the examination (masseter palpation). In this example, no zones would be needed on the exam form. In contrast, if an examiner wishes to be thorough, the present form provides self-evident documentation of what was performed. Other examination forms are available on the Consortium website – for example, one that just lists temporalis and masseter (without zones); the level of detail in terms of recording findings from these two muscles is up to the examiner.

## 9. TMJ Palpation for Joint Noises (from Section 3)

### E6 TMJ Noises During Open & Close Movements

**Instructions and Palpation.** The examiner explains that the jaw joints (TMJ) will be examined for whether they make any noise while the patient moves his or her jaw, and the patient is asked to report any noise that was felt or heard. Palpation is generally performed by placing one finger on the skin overlying the lateral pole of the TMJ condyle, and light palpation pressure is used.

**Examiner Detection of Noises.** Using palpation, the examiner will determine if joint noises are present during opening and closing. The patient will also report whether they heard or felt a joint sound. It is essential that the patient bring the posterior teeth into MICP before each open-close cycle. This maneuver insures that the full range of opening and closing has been assessed. Joint noises can be assessed either unilaterally or bilaterally, depending on circumstance. Bilateral assessment is sometimes essential in order to determine if the noise from a single click is being conducted via bone to both joints. In contrast, if the patient report of noises is clinically important, then patients typically do better by focusing on one joint at a time. Sometimes, tooth contact can be sufficiently "loud" or noticeable such that the sound can be misperceived by the examiner as a joint noise. In order to control for this, ask the patient to intentionally tap the teeth together lightly before starting the open-close procedure in order to establish a reference.
