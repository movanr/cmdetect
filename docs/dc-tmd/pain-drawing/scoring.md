# Pain Drawing

## Description

A variety of formats can be used for a pain drawing; an image of only the entire body is
most common. For primary purposes of the pain drawing in the DC/TMD Axis II, a full-
body only framework would be sufficient: a reporting of all pains and their extent is
sufficient for assessing the construct of wide-spread pain. For differential diagnostic
purposes, however, a detailed presentation of the face and intra-oral area is also of
value; the additional detailed information available via completion of those sections
should be considered for the Axis I diagnosis as well.

## Scoring

Pain reported in distinct body regions, especially if related to known regional disorders
(e.g., headache, back pain, pelvic pain, neck pain), can be summarized as a count
variable. Extent of pain can be computed as % of the body area (through use of image
scanning software; see References). Patterns of pain spreading are sometimes noted on
a drawing, as are non-anatomical distributions; the latter require qualitative
interpretation.

## Missing data

A common problem with administering a pain drawing in a dental setting is that the
respondent (patient, research subject) assumes that only pains related to the jaw and
teeth are of interest. Respondents should be asked if all pains were recorded.

## Interpretation

There is no single method for assessing and interpreting the analog drawing of pain
locations on the body. In fibromyalgia, opposite quadrants in addition to spinal area
reporting is required, whereas for widespread body pain, “several” areas appear to be
the minimum; extent of what constitutes an area is undefined. The simplest
interpretation is that each body site marked with pain increases the risk of developing
another pain disorder as well as for chronic pain. In general, the number and extent of
body areas reported as painful should be correlated with the history and relevant
clinical examination. See Description (this section) for comments about Axis I
applications of the pain drawing.
