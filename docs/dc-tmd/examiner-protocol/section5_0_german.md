# DC/TMD Protocol 5: Complete Specifications

## 5 Complete Specifications for DC/TMD Examination

### 5.1 Overview

The Complete Specifications are intended to facilitate maximal reliability in clinical technique for the researcher and clinician.

The verbal commands and associated procedures used for each component of the clinical examination are listed in a table format for ready reference. The reader should refer to Section 2 (General Instructions) and Section 3 (Description of DC/TMD Examination Procedures) for further details regarding these procedures. Figures, as referenced below, are found in Section 7. The enumeration of the examination procedures in this section corresponds to the enumeration in Section 3 and to the DC/TMD Examination Form (Section 9). Section 6 contains the Examination-Related Pain Interview, which is repeatedly referenced in the below Protocol. Section 8 lists only the required verbal commands (See 5.1, Conventions for clarification), which serve two purposes: facilitate learning the core component of the structured examination, and the required commands are the only part of the DC/TMD Clinical Examination Protocol that must be translated for use of the examination specifications in another language.

### 5.2 Conventions for Section 5.3

1. **"Verbal Commands"** as used by the examiner are of four forms:

   a. **Bold text** identifies verbal commands that should be stated verbatim by the examiner.

   b. Non-bold text identifies verbal commands or statements for which strict implementation is not expected. The examiner should follow the intent of the command or statement and convey that intent to the patient.

   c. [Square-bracketed text] denotes optional commands.

   i. "Place your mouth in a comfortable position [with your back teeth apart]" refers to a standard reference position by the patient which is required prior to most examination procedures. This command is used contingently on what the patient does. If the patient automatically returns his/her mandible to a "comfortable position" after completion of a procedure, then nothing more needs to be done by the examiner. Otherwise, the examiner should use the command. It is included with each set of procedures in order to remind the examiner that the next procedure takes as its starting point this neutral position.

   ii. All other optional commands address common situations and should be used as needed depending on the patient response during the examination procedure.

   d. \<Angle-bracketed text\> identifies instructions to the examiner.

2. _Italicized text_ denotes comments and clarifications regarding verbal commands; overlap between the comments and clarifications in this section and that in Sections 1 and 2 is intentional.

3. ALL UPPERCASE TEXT under "Verbal Commands" or "Examiner Procedures" denotes conditional instructions.

4. |Response options| are placed between vertical bars.
