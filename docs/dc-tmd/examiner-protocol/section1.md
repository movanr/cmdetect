# 1 Introduction

This document is a component of the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD); the diagnostic criteria are published elsewhere (Schiffman et al, 2013). Schiffman et al, 2013 should be cited when disorders and diagnostic criteria are referenced. See Section 1.6.

Whenever the specific methods for the DC/TMD are utilized, this Protocol document should be cited; see Section 1.4 for details.

This document is derived from research, clinical usage, and field trials. While the intent for each diagnostic test is clearly established and while the procedures have evolved based on the research as well experience across the world, the manner of describing those procedures improves over time. We expect that as more empirical data are produced, our understanding of these procedures will continue to evolve. Consequently, this is a living document and updates are anticipated to emerge following the initial release of this document; most updates are anticipated to reflect clarifications, and errors will also be identified and corrected. Please contact the lead author, Richard Ohrbach (ohrbach@buffalo.edu), with respect to questions or comments regarding this document or with respect to intent to translate.

## 1.1 If you do not read anything else, start here….

Read 1.2 Overview so you know what is in this document, and why it is in this document. Then, if you wish to use the DC/TMD for clinical purposes and do not wish to work with structured commands or calibrated procedures, read Section 4 (Concise Specifications), Section 6 (Examination-related Pain Interview), and Section 7 (Illustrations). If you wish to use the DC/TMD for research or highly structured clinical evaluations but are impatient with reading a lot of explanation, read Section 5 (Complete Specifications), Section 6 (Examination-related Pain Interview), and Section 7 (Illustrations). After either approach, apply the DC/TMD to real patients and construct diagnoses; come back to the rest of the Protocol when questions emerge. For everyone else, dive in, learn everything, be critical, and contribute to the project.

## 1.2 Overview

Section 2 describes general principles for the examination and Section 3 provides detailed explanation of the DC/TMD examination procedures.

Section 4 describes the concise examination protocol for routine clinical use. It does not attempt to capture the procedural nuances required to maximize the reliability of the examination (see Section 5 for that type of examination). A concise examination protocol is provided for two types of users: (1) clinicians who wish to use the empirically supported diagnostic criteria in a simple clinical manner, and (2) clinicians and researchers who wish to use this brief section as a review or an overview for the more detailed operational examination procedures described in Section 5.

Section 5 provides completely operationalized procedures required for clinical research applications. Clinicians may want to base their examination on these operationalized procedures in the interest of substantially enhanced reliability. The International RDC/TMD Consortium Network (hereafter, "Consortium") conducts examiner training and calibration based on these specifications. Operationalized procedures improve the examiner's clinical method and resultant decision making. Our experience is that training and on-going monitoring of skills is facilitated by placing only the verbal commands and specific operations into a table format. Refer to Section 3 for general description and clarifications.

Section 6 describes the structured pain interview that is used following any procedure-evoked pain during the examination.

Section 7 provides illustrations for these procedures. A videotape of the examination procedures will be available in the near future on the Consortium website.

Section 8 lists only the mandatory examination commands, as extracted from Sections 5 and 6, in order to facilitate learning. When these commands are committed to memory, the operationalized examination flows quickly.

Section 9 contains examination forms that list the procedures and data reporting options consistent with this protocol. The examination form is inclusive of the tests specifically linked to the DC/TMD diagnostic criteria. The form also includes reporting fields for supplemental tests (described in Sections 3-5) that are sometimes necessary for clarification of the mandatory clinical findings. Clinicians may identify other procedures that are needed for assessment of orofacial pain broadly and which are not included on this form. Supplemental examination forms may be required depending on the setting. See Section 2.2(b), Scope of examination for what the DC/TMD claims to accomplish vs what is outside the scope of the DC/TMD.

Section 10 describes research-relevant aspects of the protocol which an investigator may consider for implementation to further enhance the reliability of the examination. Information relevant for examiner reliability studies is also included. The Consortium web site contains additional information regarding reliability study design.

Section 11 (forthcoming) will list changes included in each new release as we update this protocol.

## 1.3 What has changed from RDC/TMD to DC/TMD?

An overview of the changes in the diagnostic criteria from RDC/TMD to DC/TMD is presented in Tables 1 and 2 in Schiffman et al (2013). The table below summarizes the changes in clinical examination procedures from RDC/TMD to DC/TMD. Procedures carried over from RDC/TMD to DC/TMD may have changed; see Sections 2, 3, and 5 for detailed descriptions.

- The specifications in Dworkin and LeResche (1992) were improved and tested by the RDC/TMD Validation Project (Schiffman, PI), available in a text revision (TR): Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD: Expanded Specifications for TMD Examinations with Clarifications, Prepared for the International RDC/TMD Consortium, 7/10/05, accessible at www.rdc-tmdinternational.org.

- The core verbal commands in the TR were further revised in order to create a clearer language base for translations from English to other languages. This revision is presented in Ohrbach R, John MT, Lobbezoo F, Gonzalez Y, Dworkin SF: Translation and Adaptation of the RDC/TMD, which was developed for the Committee for Translations and Protocols, International RDC-TMD Consortium, October 27, 2005, also accessible at the same URL as above. This set of verbal commands is completely consistent with the intent of the published specifications but improves on English-language ambiguities that were subsequently identified by various international sources.

- The specifications were further field tested and refined by the OPPERA (Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment) study group (NIDCR U01-DE017018; Maixner, PI and Battelle Memorial Institute) in response to feedback received by new examiners trained for that study.
