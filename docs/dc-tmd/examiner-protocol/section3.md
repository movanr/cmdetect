# 3 Description of DC/TMD Examination Procedures

## 3.1 Overview

This section provides a rationale and explanation for each examination procedure. Verbal instructions, examiner procedures, and sequencing are described in a detailed manner in Specifications Sections 4 and 5. Redundancy between this section and the two Specifications sections occurs where both general and specific points are needed. This arrangement permits Sections 4 and 5 to serve as a field manual, while this section provides explanation.

The DC/TMD protocol is applicable to both clinical and research settings. For this document, the person being examined is a "patient" while the individual performing the examination is an "examiner."

## 3.2 Why this protocol

The instructions in this document are specific to the DC/TMD. These instructions are concisely operationalized in Section 4 and completely operationalized in Section 5. Operationalized procedures accomplish a number of objectives: (1) provide the necessary elements for constructing an efficient and comprehensive set of procedures for the examination of TMD; (2) address reliability and validity issues; and (3) provide a context for what constitutes a "positive finding" as the outcome of a diagnostic test. The stated reliability and validity of the empirically-supported diagnoses comprising the DC/TMD exist only to the extent that a diagnostic test has been performed as defined. Modifying the procedures in this manual, without assessing the new reliability and its effect on diagnostic validity, leads to unknown findings in terms of empirically supported disorders. The authors of this document and the authors of the DC/TMD do not claim that these procedures are the only way to perform a TMD examination; but we do claim that these procedures are the best that have been identified and disseminated to date in terms of maximal reliability and validity.

This protocol should be cited as a supporting reference when publishing scientific communications. Because this protocol is a living document, the specific version should be cited; the Consortium web site will maintain an archive of all released versions. If the goals of the examination lie outside the purpose or scope of the DC/TMD, these instructions may require modification, and users of this protocol should clearly indicate in any communication that modifications were incorporated. Any modifications should be accompanied by rationale and explanation in order to clearly describe the frame within which a modified examination occurs since that can affect the reliability of the diagnostic procedures as well as validity of the diagnosis per the DC/TMD.

## 3.3 Identifying information

The patient name, examiner name, and date are entered at the top of the examination form (See Section 8). Other identifying information may also be included in this section of the examination form via inclusion of additional fields.

## 3.4 Instructions to the patient

Standard instructions include establishing rapport with the patient, explaining what "pain" means for examination purposes, introducing "familiar pain" and "familiar headache, and noting that the time period of interest is the prior 30 days. These instructions are stated in E1, Section 5.

## 3.5 Description of procedures

Each section of the examination is organized according to the DC/TMD Examination Form, starting with the rationale for the particular procedure followed by the description of the procedure. See Sections 4 and 5 for more detail regarding how the procedure is implemented in the clinic.

### E1 Examiner Confirmation of Pain and Headache Location

**Rationale.** Patients typically describe in the pain history the location of symptoms in anatomical terms (e.g., "TMJ", "joint"). The examiner, however, must name the symptom areas through identification of anatomical landmarks. Consequently, for the entire examination, the instructions request that the patient point to the area of pain rather than allowing the patient to indicate the involved area by name. This first step in the examination orients the patient to the areas of interest, with regard to pain and any other symptom reporting, followed by the examiner confirming the anatomical structures associated with the areas of pain complaint.

**Scope of Examination.** The examiner identifies areas on the head and face that are being addressed in this examination with respect to pain report. The purpose of this instruction is to reduce reporting symptoms associated with other areas not relevant to this examination when performed for the DC/TMD. The scope of examination, with respect to the patient's reference frame for pain reporting, can be expanded; for example, the cervical areas could be included by identifying them during the initial instructions.

**Procedure.** The areas of interest for symptom reporting are identified via light touch, with the examiner touching each area in turn. The areas are not named.

**E1_a Pain.** Ask the patient whether s/he has had pain in any of the identified areas within the prior 30 days. Examiner inquires about specific locations of pain. Follow-up question, for this and any other procedure, regarding whether other areas of pain also occur should always be considered and asked, depending on how the patient responds to the question. The patient is reminded at this point in the examination to always report all areas of pain when asked about pain locations.

**E1_b Headache.** Ask the patient to show all locations of headache experienced within the prior 30 days. If the patient inquires into whether "headache" is different from "pain" (as in the prior item, E1_a), inform the patient that each person experiences pain differently, and if a particular pain is experienced as a "headache", then that should be reported. Headache location options are "temporalis", "other", and "none" for each of right and left. For example, a bilateral frontal headache would be indicated as "other" on each side.

**Repeat Assessment.** During the course of the examination, pain location is consistently assessed in response to pain provocation procedures. The patient may subsequently report pain in an area not previously identified during E1. The examiner then returns to E1 and confirms with the patient that the new area, not previously reported, should be included. The responses in sections E1_a or E1_b are correspondingly updated to reflect the revised reporting of anatomical locations involved with pain during the last 30 days. A new area may be added to the set already reported in E1_a or E1_b, or an area already reported could also be removed as a result of a subsequent clarification at any time during the examination.

### E2 Incisal Relationships

**Rationale.** The maxillary and mandibular incisors serve as stable landmarks for reliable measurements of mandibular range of motion in vertical as well as horizontal planes of movement.

**General.** The absence of both maxillary incisors, without prosthetic replacement, makes reliable measurement of mandibular range of motion challenging. Typically, the nasopalatine papilla is used as the maxillary landmark, or a lateral incisor might be used. Reliable landmarks in the edentulous mandible are more difficult to establish; typically, the estimated midline is used.

**Select maxillary and mandibular reference teeth.** Considering the position and shape of the maxillary incisors and their opposing mandibular incisors, select maxillary right central incisor (US #8, FDI #11) as the maxillary reference tooth if the incisal edge is horizontal and the tooth is relatively well-aligned within the arch, and if the opposing mandibular incisor fulfills similar criteria. Otherwise, select the maxillary left central incisor (US #9, FDI #21) if it and the opposing central incisor better fulfill these criteria. Note that the mesial-distal center of the incisal edge of the maxillary reference tooth will be the specific maxillary reference position for all vertical and protrusive mobility measurements. The reference position of the mandibular reference tooth is the part of the tooth that opposes the mesial-distal center of the maxillary reference tooth, and it is also used for all vertical and protrusive mobility measurements. Placing a vertical line on the particular part of the maxillary reference tooth, extended down to the part of the opposing mandibular tooth, may be helpful; see "Method 2" for adjusting midlines.

**Reference line – vertical overlap.** While posterior teeth are in the MICP position, a horizontal pencil mark is placed on the buccal surface of the mandibular reference tooth in relation to the maxillary reference tooth. Reverse these instructions if anterior cross-bite exists. Insure that the examiner's line of vision is in line with the horizontal occlusal plane to minimize error in placing the line more inferior or more superior than intended on the mandibular reference tooth.

**Reference line – maxillary & mandibular midline.** Inspect the relationship between the midline between the maxillary central incisors and midline between the mandibular central incisors. If one maxillary central incisor is missing, select the mesial incisal edge of the remaining central incisor as the reference. If neither central incisor is present, then select the nasopalatine papilla as the reference. If there is a diastema, measure from the mesial edge of the selected maxillary central incisor. Use prosthetic teeth if available. If the discrepancy between the maxillary and the mandibular midline is less than 1.0mm, then select the mandibular midline as the mandibular reference-midline for lateral excursive movements and consider the midlines to have a deviation of 0mm. Use "N/A" and mark '00' mm on the examination form.

If the discrepancy is 1.0mm or more, then select one of the following three methods for adjusting the midlines.

**Method 1:** The distance between the two midlines will be measured, rounded to the lowest whole mm, and recorded on the examination form. Note the direction that the mandibular midline deviates from the maxillary midline, and mark either "right" or "left".

**Method 2:** A vertical line is drawn on the labial surface of the maxillary reference tooth, and the line is extended down onto the facial surface of the opposing mandibular reference tooth. Lateral excursion measurements are made between these two lines. Use "N/A" to indicate that the midlines have been adjusted to a difference of 0mm and leave the number of mm blank.

**Method 3:** Select the maxillary midline as the maxillary reference point, and mark the labial surface of the opposing mandibular incisor with a vertical line that extends from the maxillary midline. In this case, the pencil line on the mandibular tooth is the mandibular reference midline. Use "N/A" to indicate that the midlines have been adjusted to a difference of 0mm and leave the number of mm blank.

**Incisal Overjet (horizontal overlap).** Measure distance from labial surface of mandibular reference incisor to labial surface of maxillary reference incisor. If anterior cross-bite situation exists, the field "if negative" on the examination form will be marked.

**Incisal Overbite (vertical overlap).** Measure the distance from the mandibular incisal edge to the marked horizontal line and record the measurement by placing the zero end of the ruler next to the line and measure to the mandibular incisal edge. Reverse these instructions if anterior cross-bite exists and measure the distance on the maxillary incisor. If open bite exists, the measurement is made between maxillary and mandibular incisal edges while the mandible is in the MICP position. The measurement of open bite is registered as a negative one, and the field "if negative" on the examination form should be marked.

### E3 Opening Pattern (Supplemental)

**Rationale.** Given the difficulty of making a reliable assessment and the rare utility for contributing to a formal DC/TMD diagnosis, this procedure was not included as a core component of the DC/TMD. However, the test has presumed utility for common diagnosis of disk displacement without reduction, with limitation, and for less common diagnoses (for example, muscle contractures or muscle guarding) and for identifying adaptive patterns in response to conditions such as unilateral masseter pain or disk displacement. The primary reason for retaining the test on a routine basis, however, is that it serves as a useful "warm-up" procedure for the patient before asking the patient to perform the opening mobility movements which are measured.

**Vertical guide and starting position.** A vertical reference line to monitor mandibular movement is perhaps the best method. While many approaches exist, the maxillary midline or the vertical mark on the incisors (Method 2 for measuring incisal relations) is simple to use. The teeth should be in MICP before beginning the procedure in order to observe for any lateral deflections in full closure perhaps dictated by the occlusion and to insure that any displaced disks are not already reduced prior to the opening phase. The patient's head should not be turned to the side for the convenience of the examiner as that will potentially alter movement dynamics of the mandible during opening. The examiner may lightly depress the lower lip in order to visualize the dental reference points. The straight edge of a millimeter ruler can be held vertically as a guide by gently aligning the ruler with the reference midline.

**Opening pattern.** The examiner asks the patient to *slowly* open three times, observing from a position *directly in front of the patient* for movements of the mandible in the frontal plane that depart from a line parallel with the mid-sagital plane. Slow opening is requested in order to fully visualize any non-linear movements. Two-three seconds from closed to fully open is a sufficient pace, while one second may be sufficient for a limited opening. If the patient exhibits more than one opening pattern then score all patterns that occur according to the following criteria. Additional opening sequences are permitted if the examiner needs to verify an observation. Note that only opening patterns are recorded.

a. ***Straight.*** This is defined as no or minimally perceptible deviation (< 2mm) upon opening. Choose this option if there is uncertainty regarding presence of a deviation. If any deviation is both minimal and inconsistent from trial to trial, choose this option.

b. ***Corrected Deviation*** *(includes right, left, or both).* The mandible exhibits a perceptible deviation (≥ 2 mm) to the right and/or left but returns to the midline before or upon reaching the maximum unassisted opening. Note that if opening is straight but closing exhibits clear deviation, the opening pattern is recorded as straight.

c. ***Uncorrected deviation*** *(specify right or left).* This is defined as deviation of the mandible of ≥ 2 mm to either the right or the left from the midline with maximum unassisted opening.

### E4 Open Movements

**Rationale.** Mobility testing addresses a core sign of TMD, is one of the most reliable clinical measures, and is a clinically appropriate outcome measure.

**General.** Measurements are taken between the incisal edges of the maxillary and mandibular reference teeth, as described in E2. The specific instructions that operationalize each of these different measures are stated in Sections 4 and 5. Pain-free opening and maximum unassisted opening are patient-based measures, while maximum assisted opening is examiner-based.

**E4_A Pain Free Opening.** The patient opens for the measurement. In certain settings, repeating the test, if the pain-free opening if less than 30mm, might be appropriate in order to assess for possible low-range outlying values.

**E4_B Maximum Unassisted Opening.** The patient opens for the measurement. Ask the patient about any pain produced by this procedure.

**E4_C Maximum Assisted Opening.** The patient opens for the measurement. The sequence of steps, as driven by the verbal commands, is designed to minimize the influence of guarding due to uncertainty on the part of the patient, but guarding occurs and while a standardized procedure assists in the detection of guarding, the identification of guarding is not, at this time, operationalized. The examiner has the option of repeating the procedure if s/he believes the patient prematurely terminated the procedure or responded with resistance. Cooperation and rapport between examiner and patient is critical for the success of this particular procedure. Ask the patient about any pain produced by this procedure.

**E4_D Opening Terminated.** If patient indicates to the examiner that the procedure should be stopped, [Yes] is endorsed. If the patient indicates for the procedure to be terminated simultaneous with the examiner's percept that the assisted opening has reached its maximum, [No] should be endorsed. For all other situations, [No] should be endorsed.

### E5 Lateral and Protrusive Movements

**Rationale.** Excursive movements complement open movements for full assessment of jaw mobility. These measurements are supplemental and may be omitted. The rationale for assessing lateral movements is to document the extent of the excursive movement(s) and any resultant (induced) in pain. Moreover, in certain settings, measurement of excursive movements serves to document if condylar movement was limited versus normal. The examination form provides fields for recording the extent of movement.

**General.** Lateral excursive measurements are made between the maxillary and mandibular reference midlines, while protrusive excursive measurement is made between the labial surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular reference teeth. If the patient cannot perform a movement, indicate this on the recording form by leaving the section blank. For the lateral excursive movements, if the patient is confused about direction s/he should move his or her jaw, touch the ipsilateral side of the face, lip, or even shoulder, and ask the patient to move towards the indicated side. Lateral pressure to the jaw by the examiner, as an aid to help the patient move in the requested direction, is very difficult to calibrate and consequently is discouraged.

**E5_A Right Lateral Excursion.** Ask the patient to move mandible to the patient's right. Record any reported pain.

**E5_B Left Lateral Excursion.** Ask patient to move mandible to the patient's left. Record any reported pain.

**E5_C Protrusion.** Ask patient to move the mandible forward. Record any reported pain. Note that if the mandibular incisors cannot be protruded beyond the maxillary incisors, the value will be negative; the form should be marked for the negative number. If the incisors exhibit a Class III situation in maximum closure, the horizontal overlap is recorded as a negative value (as explained in E2), but the protrusive movement, still measured as the distance from the labial surfaces of the maxillary to mandibular incisors, will be recorded as a positive number (consistent with the Class I situation where the mandibular incisor is anterior to the maxillary incisor).

### E6 TMJ Noises During Open & Close Movements

**Rationale.** TMJ noises are a classic sign associated with TMD. However, because TMJ noises are often not stable over time, clinical diagnosis of intracapsular disorders is at best fair except for displacement without reduction, with limited opening. Because patients are often concerned about joint noises, the assessment of TMJ noise remains part of the clinical examination.

**General.** Since the 1992 publication of the RDC/TMD, much research regarding joint sounds has been published, and the Validation Project attempted to improve upon joint sound characterization and assessment. While the assessment method has been improved with the recognition of assessing pain with the sound, the definition of the joint sounds is nevertheless the same as in the RDC/TMD (1992).

**Instructions and Palpation.** The examiner explains that the jaw joints (TMJ) will be examined for whether they make any noise while the patient moves his or her jaw, and the patient is asked to report any noise that was felt or heard. Palpation is generally performed by placing one finger on the skin overlying the lateral pole of the TMJ condyle, and light palpation pressure is used.

**Examiner Detection of Noises.** Using palpation, the examiner will determine if joint noises are present during opening and closing. The patient will also report whether they heard or felt a joint sound. It is essential that the patient bring the posterior teeth into MICP before each open-close cycle. This maneuver insures that the full range of opening and closing has been assessed. Joint noises can be assessed either unilaterally or bilaterally, depending on circumstance. Bilateral assessment is sometimes essential in order to determine if the noise from a single click is being conducted via bone to both joints. In contrast, if the patient report of noises is clinically important, then patients typically do better by focusing on one joint at a time. Sometimes, tooth contact can be sufficiently "loud" or noticeable such that the sound can be misperceived by the examiner as a joint noise. In order to control for this, ask the patient to intentionally tap the teeth together lightly before starting the open-close procedure in order to establish a reference.

**Definitions of noises.**

(a) ***Click.*** A distinct noise, of brief and very limited duration, with a clear beginning and end, which usually sounds like a "click". Also referred to as a snap or pop.

(b) ***Crepitus.*** A noise that is continuous, over a longer period of jaw movement than a click or pop and can occur during part or the whole of the opening and/or closing movement. The noise is not muffled, and it may be comprised of multiple overlapping grating sounds such that it becomes "continuous"; distinguish this from the discrete sound characteristics associated with a click. Such joint noise is also often referred to as crunching, grating, or grinding sounds.

(c) ***Eminence click.*** The eminence click has to include at least an opening click and is detected when the condyle-disk complex translates around the eminence accompanied by a bodily shift of the mandible. The examiner observes for noise near the end-range of normal range of movement (i.e., at the end of normal-range opening or beginning of closing from a normal-range maximal opening). Noise detected at the end-range of vertical jaw movement that is limited is not likely representative of an eminence click. An eminence click is not reported on the examination form; it is identified only to distinguish it from the "click" that is reported.

**Recording joint noises.** Only clicking noises that meet the following criteria are scored.

(a) ***Opening click.*** If from MICP to maximum opening, a click is noted on at least one of three opening movements, record **Open Click** as [yes].

(b) ***Closing click.*** If from maximum opening to MICP, a click is present on at least one of three closing mandibular movements, record **Close Click** as [yes].

(c) ***Crepitus.*** Crepitus can be scored in addition to a click.

(d) ***None.*** Indicates that neither click nor crepitus were present during opening, closing, or both; this is scored as a [no] for each of **Click** and **Crepitus** in this examination.

**Patient report of joint noises with movement.** Any sounds that the patient perceives during any part of the joint noise evaluation are recorded separately for each of right and left joints. When the examiner has completed assessment of joint noise, the patient is asked if s/he felt or heard any joint noise. If the patient says "yes", the examiner follows with identification of type and side of all noises. If the patient reports distinct sounds such as clicking, popping or snapping sounds, these are coded as a [click] on the form. If the patient reports longer duration sounds including crunching, grinding or gratings sounds, these are coded as [Crepitus] on the form. Otherwise, [No] is coded for that side. If the patient uses terms other than those listed above under "Definitions", the examiner then asks for a description rather than assuming that a particular term necessarily refers to a specific sound such as "click" or "grating" and then determines the type of sound. A sound that the patient describes need not necessarily map to [click] or [crepitus] and such noises are most likely recorded as [No].

**Pain inquiry.** The patient is asked about pain that occurs at the same time as the clicking noise. Opening itself may cause pain, so the examiner should not assume that a "yes" response to this inquiry necessarily indicates that the click itself was painful.

---

### E7 TMJ Noises During Lateral & Protrusive Movements

**Rationale.** This test is an extension of the evaluation of TMJ noises during opening and closing movements.

**Procedures.** The examiner asks the subject to move his or her mandible to the right, to the left, and protrude just as previously performed when measuring the extent of these movements. Make sure the subject closes into MICP prior to and at the end of each movement, as with opening/closing noise assessment. A minimum of three movements is required. A noise is scored as positive any time it occurs during the lateral or protrusive movements (out or in). After the movements are completed, then assess for "Pain with click" and "Familiar pain" for any clicks reported by the patient. The definitions of the noises are the same as for **TMJ Noises During Open and Close Movements**.

---

### E8 Joint Locking

**Rationale.** Joint locking in the clinic is uncommon but it does occur. Documenting whether locking occurs or not is a useful function within the examination, given the associated pain, disability, and treatment complexity that can be associated with joint locking.

**Closed lock procedures.** If the patient's mandible suddenly locks during the process of opening, then a lock "While opening" would be recorded as [yes]. If the lock is self-reducing or the patient engages in a specific maneuver to unlock the mandible, then the patient effected a reduction (code as [yes]), whereas if the examiner has to reduce the lock, then the examiner should be coded as [yes] and the patient as [no].

**Open lock procedures.** If the patient's mandible becomes locked in the wide open position, then that type of lock is recorded as [yes]. Recording of the reduction of the lock is the same as described for the Closed lock procedures (described just previously).

---

### E9 Muscle and TMJ Pain with Palpation

**Rationale.** Pain induced in muscles via palpation is a classic clinical test. The intent is to determine if the patient reports pain from palpation of a muscle or joint and determine if any induced pain duplicates or replicates the patient's pain complaint. Several approaches are available, depending on the purpose of the examination. See Part 2.12.e for description of the examination form pertinent to temporalis and masseter palpation.

#### General

(a) Palpating the muscles and joint capsules for pain requires that the examiner press on a specific site using the spade-like pad of one finger (the second or third digits; or index finger or middle finger) with standardized pressure. The "spade-like" area of the finger is the space between the tip (just adjacent to the edge of finger nail) and the finger-print area. One finger is used and finger placement is as shown in the illustrations, Section 7.

(b) Within each group of muscle sites as indicated on the examination form, apply pressure to the right side and then to the left side. When applying pressure, support the head or mandible by placing the other hand on the opposite side of the head in order to provide stability. During palpation, the patient's mandible should be in a comfortable position, without the teeth touching.

(c) Each major muscle (temporalis, masseter) is divided into 3 zones for purposes of insuring that the muscle is examined in a consistent manner. Responses may be recorded for each zone or for the muscle as a whole; alternate examination forms exist for each approach. Within each zone, 3-5 areas should be palpated, depending on the size of the muscle and the intent of the examination.

(d) Due to the inherent difficulty in an examiner exactly calibrating his/her finger pressure when going from measurement scale to actual palpation, the examiner should target no less than the indicated value. For example, a target of 1 kg should be at least as great as 1.0 kg but not less. Target "pressures" are 1 kg (as measured by a force meter) to the temporalis and masseter muscles and around the lateral pole of the TMJ and 0.5 kg to the lateral condylar pole of the TMJ and any supplemental muscle areas.

(e) If the examiner is unable to palpate at the specified amount of pressure due to the patient's physical withdrawal or the patient's request for the palpation to be more gentle, then such information is recorded in the Examination Comments section, and the palpation should be modified accordingly.

(f) In a given setting, diagnosis of myalgia may be the sufficient end-point and further investigation for presence of referred pain may not be needed. If so, the palpation and pain reporting procedures (by the patient) should be accordingly modified.

(g) **Summary of palpation principles**
   - i. Locate, then palpate.
   - ii. Press on the site using the correct amount of steady pressure, without moving the fingers sideways or rubbing the area.
   - iii. Be systematic in how each defined region is examined.

#### Approaches

(a) In addition to setting stimulus intensity, palpation consists of two additional parameters that can be altered depending on the clinical or research question to be answered: location and stimulus duration.

(b) Location consists of how much of a structure is examined; the masseter and temporalis are large enough that more than a few palpation sites are required to fully examine the muscle. Such structures may be examined by applying the palpation pressure to every aspect of the muscle in order to insure that no area is missed, or a sampling approach may be used where only selected parts of the muscle are examined on a routine basis. In clinical settings, a sampling approach is often augmented by additional palpation as guided by the patient history and diagnostic hypotheses. Other smaller structures such as the TMJ are readily examined in a complete manner.

(c) Stimulus duration refers to how long the palpation pressure is held. The minimum duration for the DC/TMD is 2 seconds (which is sufficient for a diagnosis of myalgia but likely insufficient for a referred pain diagnosis), and a duration of (at least) 5 seconds is recommended if identification of referred pain is important. There are two methods associated with stimulus duration, depending on the desired outcome from the examination.

(d) **Method 1.** Use 5 seconds duration for every palpation. If false negative diagnoses for myofascial pain with referral must be minimized, then palpation of every muscle and joint site with (at least) 5 full seconds of palpation pressure is necessary, and referred pain and hyperalgesia will be more reliably detected. Watching a clock to insure adequate stimulus duration is recommended.

   a. To shorten the time required for the palpation procedures, after 2 seconds or so and while continuing to hold the pressure, the examiner may prompt with the question of "pain?", and other prompts ("familiar?", "familiar headache?", and "referred?") may be possible within the remaining time until (at least) 5 seconds has elapsed. Any unasked pain inquiry questions may then be asked for that palpation site.

   b. To reduce impact of multiple "pain?" prompts, simply ask about pain just before the end of the 5-second pressure application, and then proceed with the remaining prompts after removing the pressure.

   c. The intent of the prolonged palpation (holding a pressure for a full 5 seconds) is to identify the possible presence of referred pain. This procedure can be altered depending on patient response; a highly pain-sensitive individual may not readily tolerate 5 seconds of pressure in a given area, and the Comments section of the examination form should be used for recording such observations and that, for example, the examination for referred pain was not performed. However, in practice 5-seconds of pressure is tolerable.

(e) **Method 2.** Use 2 seconds duration for every palpation. If identification of referred pain is not important in a given examination or setting, then palpation with only 2 seconds duration will be generally sufficient to identify myalgia and arthralgia. This approach is particularly well-suited if the clinical evaluation serves as a gateway for referral. Instructions include: **Now I am going to apply pressure to different areas of your head and jaw, and I will ask about pain.** And: **I will hold the pressure for 5 seconds [or 2 seconds], and I will then ask you about pain; please tell me yes or no, and if so I will then ask you if the pain is familiar, and if the pain stays under my finger or if you feel it also in different areas of your head or jaw.**

#### Description of Specific Extraoral Muscle Sites

(a) *Temporalis Anterior – 1.0 kg.* Start just posterior to the bony crest lateral to the eyebrow and superior to the zygomatic process of the temporal bone. Request muscle contraction via patient clenching as necessary in order to insure that muscle tissue is beneath the finger. The area for palpation lies along a curve parallel to the anterior extent of the muscle; lightly palpate for the bony crest defining the anterior boundary of the temporal fossa.

(b) *Temporalis Middle – 1.0 kg.* Start just anterior of the ear and superior to the zygomatic process of the temporal bone; the area for palpation is directly superior.

(c) *Temporalis Posterior – 1.0 kg.* Start just above the superior tip of the ear; the area for palpation is directly superior. Ask the patient to clench and then relax to help identify muscle boundaries, as necessary.

(d) *Origin of Masseter – 1.0 kg.* Request that the patient first clench and then relax in order to confirm (1) the location of the posterior extent of the muscle with respect to the anterior border of the TMJ condyle and (2) the anterior border of the masseter. Start at the posterior extent, just inferior to the zygomatic process of the temporal bone; the area for palpation is directly anterior.

(e) *Body of the Masseter – 1.0 kg.* Start at the posterior boundary of the muscle, midway between origin and insertion. The area for palpation is directly anterior.

(f) *Insertion of the Masseter – 1.0 kg.* Start at the posterior boundary of the muscle, just superior to the inferior mandibular border; the area for palpation is directly anterior.

#### Description of Specific Joint Palpation Sites

(a) *Lateral Pole – 0.5 kg.* Place index finger just anterior to the tragus of the ear and on the skin overlying the patient's TMJ. In order to confirm location, ask the patient to open or protrude slightly until the examiner feels the lateral pole of the condyle translated forward.

(b) *Around the Lateral Pole – 1.0 kg.* While the mandible is in the comfort position or in a slightly protruded position, place index finger just anterior to the tragus of the ear and dorsal to the TMJ. While the mandible is supported from the other side, the index finger presses while orbiting around the lateral pole in a circular fashion over the superior aspect of the condyle and then anteriorly – i.e., from the 9:00 to the 3:00 position, and then continuing fully around the condyle. Two-five seconds duration for this procedure yields the appropriate pace of finger movement.

**Examiner calibration.** The examiner calibrates the necessary fingers at the specified palpation "pressure", just prior to that set of palpations.

**Examination sequence.** A practice trial is optional and may be performed on the deltoid muscle or frontalis muscle. Figures related to palpation are shown in Section 7. In order to maximize examiner consistency, the following sequence is used:

- Temporalis and masseter, right side and then left side (1 kg), following order of zones as listed above.
- Lateral pole of TMJ, right side and then left side (0.5 kg)
- Around the TMJ condyle, right side and then left side (1 kg)
- Supplemental muscles (0.5 kg), as indicated.

**Palpation and pain inquiry.** The examiner inquires about pain from the palpation, whether the pain is familiar, and the anatomical extent of the pain. For the latter, the examiner asks the patient to show (with a fingertip) where the pain was felt. Verbal responses such as "to my ear" or "deep" are accepted as evidence of extension of the palpation-induced pain, while ambiguous responses from the patient are interpreted as [no]. This protocol requires that "referral" denotes pain felt in a different structure than that which is being examined via palpation.

### E10 Supplemental Muscles

**Rationale.** Additional sites may be examined as per the protocol in E9.

---

### E11 Examiner Comments

**Rationale.** The examiner records any observations that are deemed pertinent towards understanding any findings. Any barriers that compromised any part of the examination are also recorded here; see Section 2.4(d) for details. Any clinical observations that may affect diagnosis should be recorded here as well.
