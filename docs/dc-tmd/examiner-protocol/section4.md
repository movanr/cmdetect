# 4 Concise Specifications for DC/TMD Examination

## 4.1 Overview

The intended user of the Concise Specifications is the individual (clinician or researcher) who wishes to use empirically validated diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders while retaining a simple examination. The verbal commands and associated procedures used for each component of the clinical examination are listed here in a table format for ready reference. The reader should refer to Section 2 (General Instructions) for the full context of the examination. Full description of the procedures is provided in Section 3, and the fully operationalized version of these procedures is provided in Section 5. Figures, as referenced below, are found in Section 7. The enumeration of the examination procedures in this section corresponds to that in Section 5 as well as on the DC/TMD Examination Form (Section 8).

## 4.2 Examination-related Pain Interview

Inform the patient that s/he might experience pain during the clinical exam, and if so, s/he will be asked additional questions. When this sequence of question and response is used as part of the exam, the specifications (below) indicate "Conduct Examination-related Pain Interview." The detailed version is in Section 6.

***Familiar pain.*** If the patient reports pain as a result of an examination procedure, then ask the patient if it is "familiar pain", that is, pain "similar" or "like" the pain s/he has experienced in the last 30 days in the same region (i.e., his or her pain complaint). Remind the patient that you are trying to replicate or duplicate his or her pain so that you can locate the source of the pain.

***Familiar headache.*** If the patient reports pain in the temples as a result of an examination procedure, then ask the patient if it is "familiar headache", that is, pain similar or like the headache s/he has experienced in the temple area (s) in the last 30 days.

***Referred pain.*** If the patient reports familiar pain as a result of muscle or TMJ palpation or familiar headache as a result of temporalis muscle palpation, then the palpation is repeated and the patient is asked if s/he felt pain anywhere else beyond the immediate area of the examiner's palpation. It is considered *referred pain* if s/he reports pain beyond the boundary of the muscle or joint being palpated (i.e., perceived in another structure). It is not referred pain if s/he reports pain extending beyond the area of provocation but only within the boundary of the muscle or joint.

***Efficient Completion of the Examination-related Pain Interview.*** After several positive responses from the pain provoking procedures, the examiner can instruct the patient to respond in an abbreviated form. For example, the patient might be instructed to report, in response to positive palpation findings, as follows: "yes, familiar" or "yes, not familiar" in order to eliminate the repetitive asking of whether positive pain findings are familiar or not.

## 4.3 Measurements

Measurements are rounded down to the nearest whole mm and recorded only as integer numbers.

## 4.4 Completion of examination form

The examination form is organized so that a 'no' response in any multi-response field (e.g., pain from maximum unassisted opening in the temporalis muscle) will complete that set of response options; in contrast, a 'yes' response requires that the remainder of the response options (e.g., familiar pain, familiar headache, and referred pain) be completed.

### E2. Incisal Relationships

| EXAM ITEM | COMMUNICATION TO PATIENT | EXAMINER PROCEDURE |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Select maxillary and mandibular reference teeth** | \<none\> | - Typically the measurements done in this section use either the right or left pair of maxillary and mandibular central incisors.<br>- Use the same two reference teeth for all subsequent measurements. |

| EXAM ITEM | COMMUNICATION TO PATIENT | EXAMINER PROCEDURE |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Reference line – vertical overlap** | Ask patient to gently place his or her back teeth completely together (where they fit together the best). | - With a pencil, mark the horizontal reference line where the incisal edge of the mesial-distal center of the maxillary reference tooth overlaps the opposing mandibular incisor.<br>- If anterior cross-bite, reverse the instructions. |

Record "N/A" on exam form.<br>- Two other options are described in Section 5. |

**Figures 5 & 6:** Midline reference methods

For uncorrected deviation, observe with full opening if the deviation is to the right or left side. |
