# DC/TMD Protocol 5: Complete Specifications for Examination

## 5 Complete Specifications for DC/TMD Examination

### 5.1 Overview

The Complete Specifications are intended to facilitate maximal reliability in clinical technique for the researcher and clinician.

The verbal commands and associated procedures used for each component of the clinical examination are listed in a table format for ready reference. The reader should refer to Section 2 (General Instructions) and Section 3 (Description of DC/TMD Examination Procedures) for further details regarding these procedures. Figures, as referenced below, are found in Section 7. The enumeration of the examination procedures in this section corresponds to the enumeration in Section 3 and to the DC/TMD Examination Form (Section 9). Section 6 contains the Examination-Related Pain Interview, which is repeatedly referenced in the below Protocol. Section 8 lists only the required verbal commands (See 5.1, Conventions for clarification), which serve two purposes: facilitate learning the core component of the structured examination, and the required commands are the only part of the DC/TMD Clinical Examination Protocol that must be translated for use of the examination specifications in another language.

---

### 5.2 Conventions for Section 5.3

1. **"Verbal Commands"** as used by the examiner are of four forms:

   a. **Bold text** identifies verbal commands that should be stated verbatim by the examiner.

   b. Non-bold text identifies verbal commands or statements for which strict implementation is not expected. The examiner should follow the intent of the command or statement and convey that intent to the patient.

   c. [Square-bracketed text] denotes optional commands.

   i. "Place your mouth in a comfortable position [with your back teeth apart]" refers to a standard reference position by the patient which is required prior to most examination procedures. This command is used contingently on what the patient does. If the patient automatically returns his/her mandible to a "comfortable position" after completion of a procedure, then nothing more needs to be done by the examiner. Otherwise, the examiner should use the command. It is included with each set of procedures in order to remind the examiner that the next procedure takes as its starting point this neutral position.

   ii. All other optional commands address common situations and should be used as needed depending on the patient response during the examination procedure.

   d. \<Angle-bracketed text\> identifies instructions to the examiner.

2. _Italicized text_ denotes comments and clarifications regarding verbal commands; overlap between the comments and clarifications in this section and that in Sections 1 and 2 is intentional.

3. ALL UPPERCASE TEXT under "Verbal Commands" or "Examiner Procedures" denotes conditional instructions.

4. |Response options| are placed between vertical bars.

## E1. Examiner Confirmation of Pain and Headache Locations

### Identifying information

| CONSTRUCT                | VERBAL COMMAND | EXAMINER PROCEDURE |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Identifying information  | _\<none\>_     | Examiner enters patient name, examiner name, and date on examination form. |

### Instructions to the patient

**Verbal Commands:**

> Before I start the exam, I want to review a few things with you.
>
> I will be asking you about pain, and only you know if you have pain. When I ask about pain, I want you to say either yes or no; if you are not sure, give me your best answer.
>
> If you feel pain, I will also ask if that pain is familiar. Familiar pain refers to pain that is similar or like the pain you may have had in that same part of your body in the last 30 days.
>
> If you feel pain in the temple area, I will ask if that pain is like any headache you may have had in the temple area in the last 30 days.

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Pain as defined here is absolute but translation into local terms (or other language) requires attention to cultural standards. Intention is to clearly place responsibility for determination of pain on the patient, and the only response that can be accepted is either "yes" or "no".
- Definition of "familiar pain" may require some elaboration when it is first asked during the examination. Other related words include "similar" or "feels like".

---

### Scope of examination: anatomic areas of interest

_Figure 1_

**Verbal Commands:**

> For the purposes of this examination, I am interested in pain that you may have in these areas….
>
> …. and also inside the mouth.

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Examiner touches, bilaterally at the same time, the following 4 areas in sequence: temporalis, preauricular, masseter, and posterior/submandibular areas.
- Examiner says "here" while touching each of the above areas.
- The areas are not named anatomically as they are touched.

---

### E1a. Location of pain: last 30 days

_Figures 2 & 3_

**Verbal Commands:**

> In the last 30 days, have you had pain in these areas [that I touched]?
>
> IF "YES":
>
> Could you point with your finger to each of the areas where you have felt pain [in the last 30 days]?
>
> Are there any other areas where you have felt pain [in the last 30 days]?
>
> IF "YES", EXAMINER CONFIRMS:
>
> Let me confirm where you just pointed.

**Examiner Procedure:**

IF PATIENT REPORTS NO PAIN IN THE AREAS OF INTEREST:

- Record "None" for each of right side and left side in Q1a.

IF PATIENT REPORTS PAIN IN THE AREAS OF INTEREST:

- Examiner inquires into all locations.
- Examiner touches involved areas to confirm location with patient and inquires "here?"
- Record pain locations in Q1a.

---

### E1b. Location of headache in the last 30 days

**Verbal Commands:**

> In the last 30 days, have you had any headaches?
>
> IF "YES":
>
> Could you point with your finger to each of the areas where you have felt headaches [in the last 30 days]?
>
> Are there any other areas where you have felt headaches [in the last 30 days]?
>
> IF "YES", EXAMINER CONFIRMS:
>
> Let me confirm your headache locations where you just pointed.

**Examiner Procedure:**

IF PATIENT REPORTS NO HEADACHE OR NO HEADACHE IN INDICATED AREAS:

- Record "None" for each of right side and left side in Q1b.

IF PATIENT REPORTS HEADACHE:

- Examiner inquires into all locations.
- Examiner touches involved areas to confirm location with patient, and inquires "here?".
- Record pain locations in Q1b.

## E2. Incisal Relationships

### Select maxillary and mandibular reference teeth

**Verbal Commands:**

> In order to visualize the teeth
>
> Open slightly.
>
> I will place some pencil marks on your teeth; I will remove them at the end of the examination.

**Examiner Procedure:**

- The potential maxillary and mandibular reference teeth need to be visualized at the same time as they are selected jointly.
- Choose maxillary right central incisor (US #8; FDI #11) if the incisal edge is horizontal, the tooth is vertically oriented, and the tooth is not rotated; else, select tooth US#9 (FDI #21) if it better fits these criteria. See Section 3, E2, for further instructions. Enter selected tooth on the examination form.
- Note that the mesial-distal center of the maxillary reference tooth will be the specific maxillary reference position for all vertical and protrusive mobility measurements.
- Select mandibular reference tooth, which opposes the mesial-distal center of the maxillary reference tooth.
- The location of the incisal edge of the mandibular reference tooth that is opposite the mesial-distal center of the maxillary reference tooth represents the mandibular reference position for all vertical mobility measurements.
- The buccal surface of the mandibular reference tooth that is opposite the mesial-distal center of the maxillary reference tooth represents the mandibular reference position for protrusive mobility measurements.

---

### Reference line – vertical overlap

_Figure 4_

**Verbal Commands:**

> Place your back teeth completely together.

**Examiner Procedure:**

- With a pencil, mark the horizontal reference line where the central portion of the incisal edge of the maxillary reference tooth overlaps the opposing mandibular incisor.
- If anterior cross-bite, reverse the instructions.

---

### Reference line – mandibular reference midline

_Figures 5 & 6_

**Verbal Commands:**

> [Place your back teeth completely together.]
>
> \<If needed, then ask patient to open slightly so that the mandibular embrasures can be observed.\>

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Assess maxillary and mandibular dental midlines; if the discrepancy between the maxillary and mandibular dental midline is < 1mm, then record '0' mm.
- If the discrepancy in the midline is > 1 mm, select one of the following:
- **Method 1:** Measure the distance of any discrepancy (> 1mm) in the frontal plane between the maxillary and mandibular dental midlines and note the direction of the discrepancy of the mandibular midline relative to the maxillary midline. The mandibular dental midline is now the reference for measuring lateral mandibular movement.
- **Method 2:** Draw a vertical line on the face of the maxillary central incisor and extend the line to the opposing mandibular incisor. The vertical pencil marks on the two incisors are now the reference midlines.
- **Method 3:** Extend, using a vertical pencil mark, the maxillary dental midline onto the corresponding mandibular incisor. The vertical pencil mark on the mandibular incisor is now the reference midline for the mandible.
- If anterior cross-bite, reverse the above instructions with regard to maxillary and mandibular.
- If using Method 1, record the measurement and direction.
- If using Methods 2 or 3, record the value '0'.

---

### Horizontal incisal overjet

_Figure 7_

**Verbal Commands:**

> [Place your back teeth completely together.]

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Verify teeth are in maximum intercuspation.
- Measure the distance from the mesiodistal midpoint of the facial surface of the selected maxillary central incisor to the facial surface of the opposing mandibular incisor on a horizontal plane.
- If anterior cross-bite is present, then mark "negative".
- Record the measurement.

---

### Vertical incisal overlap

_Figure 8_

**Verbal Commands:**

> \<Ask patient to open sufficiently to measure the vertical overlap.\>

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Measure the distance that the maxillary tooth overlaps the mandibular tooth.
- If an anterior open-bite is present, measure the distance between the edges of the maxillary and mandibular incisors and mark "negative".
- If anterior cross-bite is present, reverse the above instructions.
- Record the measurement.

---

### Incisal relationships – additional notes

**Examiner Procedure:**

- If anterior cross-bite or open bite, then specific measures will also include marking the "negative" field on the exam form.

---

## E3. Opening Pattern (Supplemental)

### Opening Pattern

_Figures 9 & 10_

**Verbal Commands:**

> Place your back teeth completely together.
>
> I would like you to slowly open your mouth as wide as you can, even if it is painful, close, and put your back teeth completely together again.
>
> Repeat 2 more times.

*Alternative Format:*
*In English, the common expression is "open as wide as you can" but other languages may differ; for example, "as much as you can" is often better in other languages.*

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Observe if the opening movement is: straight (no observed deviation: < 2mm to either side of the midline), corrected (i.e., S- or C-curve deviation, >2mm), or uncorrected (i.e., lateral deviation, >2mm).
- For uncorrected deviation, observe at full opening if the deviation is to the right or left side.
- More than one option may be selected; this allows recording of any type of movement in case the movement is not consistent across repeated trials.
- Repeat 2 more times.

## E6. TMJ Noises During Open & Close Movements

### General instructions to examiner

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Patients may use a variety of terms for the single-occurrence joint noise (e.g., "click", "pop", "snap"); any of these terms denote a "click" for purposes of the exam, and the instructions below refer to the term "Click" on the recording form.
- Patients may use a variety of terms for the fine, multiple-occurrence joint noise (e.g., "grating", "grinding", "crepitus"); any of these terms denotes "crepitus" for purposes of the examination, and the instructions below refer to the term "Crepitus" on the recording form.

---

### Hand position for palpation of joint noise

_Figure 22_

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Use of bilateral or unilateral palpation depends on examiner preference and circumstances.
- Bilateral palpation: Place finger of each hand over the corresponding TMJ. This method requires that the patient monitor noises from both TMJs at the same time, which may be difficult.
- Unilateral palpation: Use same finger placement for a single joint, as described for bilateral palpation, assessing first the right TMJ and then the left TMJ.
- Repeat following instructions for each TMJ separately.

---

### Instructions regarding joint noises

**Verbal Commands:**

> I will be evaluating the jaw joints for whether they make any noises. I would like you to pay attention as well, since I will ask you at the end whether you heard or felt any noises.
>
> [Focus on both joints.]

**Examiner Procedure:**

- If doing bilateral palpation, touch both joints and ask patient to attend to both joints.
- If doing unilateral palpation, touch the targeted joint and ask patient to attend to that joint.

---

### Full closure of mandible

**Verbal Commands:**

> Place your back teeth completely together.

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Insure that the teeth are in maximal intercuspal position in order to insure that the TMJ is in the closed position.

---

### Examiner detection of open and closing joint noises

**Verbal Commands:**

> Slowly open as wide as you can, even if it is painful, and then slowly close until your back teeth are completely together again.
>
> Repeat 2 more times.

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Mandible should be opened and closed slowly, allowing about 2 seconds to open and about 2 seconds to close. Guide patient accordingly.
- At the end of closing, distinguish noises from teeth contacting.
- Record a noise as a "click" or "crepitus" if it is present on at least 1 of the 3 movements. Multiple types of noise can be present in a single joint.

---

### Patient inquiry regarding joint noises

**Verbal Commands:**

> Did you hear or feel noises in either jaw joint when you opened or closed?
>
> IF "YES":
>
> What type of noise?
>
> \<The patient may be prompted by offering the words of different jaw joint sounds: click, pop, snap, grate, grind, crunch.\>

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Examiner can interview patient if necessary in order to confirm location (right vs left, or both) of noises.
- If patient detects joint noise but is unable to classify the noise as a click or crepitus, then examiner may repeat the open-close movement again in order for the patient to reassess type of noise.

---

### Pain inquiry

**Verbal Commands:**

> IF PATIENT REPORTS CLICK:
>
> Did you feel any pain when that click occurred?
>
> See PAIN INTERVIEW
> 6.2.3: Click-related pain
> 6.2.4: Familiar pain

**Examiner Procedure:**

- IF EXAMINER DETECTS CLICK BUT PATIENT CANNOT DETECT THE NOISE, THEN "No" IS RECORDED FOR PATIENT DETECTION OF NOISE.

---

## E7. TMJ Noises During Lateral & Protrusive Movements

### General

_Figure 23_

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Fingers are placed in the same position as indicated for TMJ noises on open and close.
- Noises with excursive movement may be assessed while palpating both TMJs simultaneously or palpating one joint at a time.
- Instructions below are written for examination of one joint at a time, but bilateral palpation and assessment is permitted.
- Repeat instructions for other joint if examining each joint separately.

---

### Joint noises: lateral and protrusive movements

**Verbal Commands:**

> Place your back teeth completely together, open slightly, and move your lower jaw to the right as far as you can, even if painful; move your jaw back and place your back teeth completely together.
>
> Repeat 2 more times.
>
> Place your back teeth completely together, open slightly, and move your lower jaw to the left as far as you can, even if painful; move your jaw back and place your back teeth completely together.
>
> Repeat 2 more times.
>
> Place your back teeth completely together, open slightly, and move your lower jaw forward as far as you can, even if painful; move your jaw back, and place your back teeth completely together.
>
> Repeat 2 more times.

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Place fingers over the TMJ(s).
- If the patient is confused about which direction to move the jaw, say "Move your jaw towards this hand" and touch the patient's jaw or shoulder on the side of the desired movement.
- Diagnosis of disc displacement with reduction requires presence of either a click during both opening and closing movements, OR a click during one of open or closing movements coupled with a click during any of protrusion, right lateral, or left lateral movement.
- The presence of both types of noise (click and crepitus) in a joint in any direction may be sufficient finding for this test to then be stopped, depending on what other information the examiner wishes to obtain (such as whether a noise occurs in a particular movement).
- Record this finding.

---

### Inquiry regarding joint noises

**Verbal Commands:**

> Did you hear or feel any noises in this [right, left] joint when you moved your jaw forward or to the side?
>
> IF "YES":
>
> What type of noise?
>
> \<The patient may be prompted with the words of different jaw joint sounds: click, pop, snap, grate, grind, crunch.\>

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Examiner touches the patient's right TMJ while asking the question.
- Examiner can interview patient if necessary in order to localize location (right vs left) of noises.

---

### Pain inquiry

**Verbal Commands:**

> IF PATIENT REPORTS CLICK:
>

### General

_Figure 24_

**Examiner Procedure:**

- Select coverage method for palpation of the larger muscles: comprehensive where every part of the muscle is palpated, or sampling areas of the muscle.
- Select time duration for stimulus application: (a) 2 seconds for efficiency and ignoring referred pain diagnosis, (b) 5 seconds to minimize false negative diagnoses of referred pain and to better identify hyperalgesia.

---

### Instructions

**Verbal Commands:**

> Now I am going to apply pressure to different areas of your head, face and jaw, and I will ask you about pain, familiar pain, and familiar headache.
>
> In addition, I will ask whether the pain stays only under my finger or if you feel it also anywhere else besides under my finger.
>
> I will prompt you with the words "pain?", "familiar pain?", "familiar headache?", and "only under my finger?".
>
> [Inquiry "go anywhere else?" can be used instead of "only under my finger" if the examiner prefers.]
>
> Each time, I will apply pressure and hold it for 5 seconds.
