For example, in an individual with recurrent pain who has been pain-free in the 30 days prior to a consultation, palpation might elicit a pain that the patient remembers from a pain episode more than 30 days previously. The default time-frame for pain relevant to a diagnosis per the DC/TMD is the prior 30 days. However, different clinical or research situations may require a different time period. Consequently the time frame for "familiar pain" might need to be altered. Record any alternative time period in Section 11 of the exam form._ |

## 6.3 Efficient Completion

After the first several positive responses from pain-provoking procedures and depending on the purpose of the examination and the patient's ability to easily distinguish the presence of pain, familiar pain, familiar headache, and referred pain, the examiner can instruct the patient to respond to the Pain Interview in a more abbreviated manner. For example, the patient might be instructed to report, in response to positive palpation findings, as follows: "yes, familiar" or "yes, not familiar" in order to eliminate asking whether each positive pain finding is familiar or not. After establishing that positive pain responses are familiar to the patient's clinical pain from at least 2 positive examination procedures, the examiner need only ask if the pain is familiar but need not ask "familiar to what" unless an area not yet recorded in examination item 1 is reported as positive in response to a procedure.
